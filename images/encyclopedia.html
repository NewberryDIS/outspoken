	  <h1>The Encyclopedia of Chicago </h1>

	  <h3>(October 2004, $65.00, University of Chicago Press)</h3>

	  <h2>Event: Creating <i>The Encyclopedia of Chicago</i></h2>
	  <p><i>Saturday, November 13, from 10:00–11:00 a.m.</i><br />
	  Note location: The Newberry Library, 60 W. Walton St.<br />

	  This program, which is part of the Chicago Humanities
	  Festival, features the three editors of <i>The Encyclopedia
	  of Chicago</i>—James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and
	  Janice L. Reiff—discussing their creative process. How were
	  decisions made about what and what not to include?</p>

	  <hr />



	  <p>One of the great American metropolises, Chicago rises out
	  of the prairie in the heart of the country, buffeted by
	  winds coming off the plains and cooled by the waters of the
	  inland sea of Lake Michigan. Chicago is a city of size and
	  mass, the cradle of modern architecture, the freight hub of
	  the nation, a city built on slaughterhouses and cacophonous
	  financial trading tempered by some of the finest cultural
	  institutions in the world. While many histories have been
	  written of the city, none can claim the scope and breadth of
	  the long-awaited <i>Encyclopedia of Chicago.</i></p>
	  <p>Developed by the Newberry Library with the cooperation of
	  the Chicago Historical Society, <i>The Encyclopedia of
	  Chicago</i> is the definitive historical reference on
	  metropolitan Chicago. More than a decade in the making, the
	  <i>Encyclopedia</i> brings together hundreds of historians,
	  journalists, and experts on everything from airlines to
	  Zoroastrians to explore all aspects of the rich world of
	  Chicagoland, from its geological prehistory to the
	  present. </p>
	  <p>The main alphabetical section of the <i>Encyclopedia,</i>
	  comprising more than 1,400 entries, covers the full range of
	  Chicago's neighborhoods, suburbs, and ethnic groups as well
	  as the city’s cultural institutions, technology and science,
	  architecture, religions, immigration, transportation,
	  business history, labor, music, health and medicine, and
	  hundreds of other topics. The <i>Encyclopedia</i> has the
	  widest geographical reach of any city encyclopedia of its
	  kind, encompassing eight of the region’s counties, including
	  suburbs. Nearly 400 thumbnail maps pinpoint Chicago
	  neighborhoods and suburban municipalities; these maps are
	  complemented by hundreds of black-and-white and color
	  photographs and thematic maps that bring the history of
	  metropolitan Chicago to life. Additionally, contributors
	  have provided lengthy interpretive essays—woven into the
	  alphabetical section but set off graphically—that take a
	  long view of such topics as the built environment, literary
	  images of Chicago, and the city’s legendary and passionate
	  sports culture.</p>
	  <p>The <i>Encyclopedia</i> also offers a comprehensive biographical
	  dictionary of more than 2,000 individuals important to
	  Chicago history and a detailed listing of approximately 250
	  of the city’s historically significant business
	  enterprises. A color insert features a timeline of Chicago
	  history and photo essays exploring nine pivotal years in
	  this history.</p>
	  <p>The <i>Encyclopedia of Chicago</i> is one of the most
	  significant historical projects undertaken in the last
	  twenty years, and it has everything in it to engage the most
	  curious historian as well as settle the most boisterous
	  barroom dispute. If you think you know how Chicago got its
	  name, if you have always wondered how the Chicago Fire
	  actually started and how it spread, if you have ever
	  marveled at the Sears Tower or the reversal of the Chicago
	  River—if you have affection, admiration, and appreciation
	  for this City of the Big Shoulders, this Wild Onion, this
	  <i>Urbs in Horto,</i> then <i>The Encyclopedia of
	  Chicago</i> is for you.</p>
