	 <P>How do you decide who gets your vote to lead the nation? Do you base
	 your decision on a candidate's political experience, military service, personal
	 charisma, or a campaign slogan? The electoral process has changed since the
	 nation's first presidential election in 1789; the mechanices of voting are
	 different and the right to suffrage has expanded. Still, matters of voter
	 participation, negative campaigning, and fraud have remained perennial issues.
	 Spanning almost a hundred and fifty years of presidential politics, these
	 objects drawn from the Newberry's general and special collections highlight the
	 ways that Americans have struggled with these questions and concerns.<BR>

	 Parsons<BR>December 16, 1823</B><BR>Newberry Library: Ayer MS
	 60</FONT><BR>Approximately a year before Andrew Jackson's unsuccessful bid for
	 the presidency in 1824, Massachusetts Representative Francis Baylies remarks in
	 this letter about Jackson's growing popularity and attributes it to his
	 military service. Jackson won the popular vote and the greatest number of
	 electoral votes. Nonetheless, he did not win more than 50 percent of the
	 Electoral College and the decision was turned over to the House of
	 Representatives. Contemporaries accused Speaker of the House Henry Clay of
	 negotiating a "corrupt bargain" to secure John Quincy Adams the presidency and
	 his own subsequent appointment as secretary of state. Four years later, Jackson
	 ran against Adams again and won.<BR> <BR> <FONT COLOR="#990000"><B><I>Campaign

	 Press, 1848<BR>Newberry Library: Y 273. 14</FONT><BR>Established in 1847, the
	 Free Soil Party was the first anti-slavey political coalition in the North to
	 win mass support. Its motto was "Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor and Free
	 Men." In trying to capture public appeal, the Free Soilers set their rally
	 songs to familiar music. In this compilation, "Conscience and Free Soil" is set
	 to the tune of "Auld Lang Syne." Although he did not capture any electoral
	 votes, the party's presidential nominee, former president Martin Van Buren, won
	 10 percent of the popular vote in 1848. In the same election, the Free Soilers
	 won several seats in the House of Representatives. The party merged with the
	 new Republican Party in the 1850s.<BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="#990000"><B><I>Wells'

	 Candidates for President and Vice President</I></B><BR>New York: J.G. Wells,
	 1860<BR>Newberry Library: J 583 .965</FONT><BR> Severe sectional divisions led
	 to fragmented politics in the election of 1860, with four candidates. The
	 Republican Party, nominating a candidate for only the second time, chose
	 Abraham Lincoln. The Democrats split over the question of federal protection of
	 slavery in the western territories, with Northern Democrats supporting Stephen
	 A. Douglas, and Southern Democrats nominating John Breckenridge at a separate
	 convention. Some former Whigs sought to attract votes to a Constitutional Union
	 Party under John Bell. Sam Houston, who had lost his bid for the Constitutional
	 Union Party nomination, ran an independent candidacy for several months before
	 withdrawing to support Bell. In the end, Lincoln and Douglas were strong only
	 in the Northern states, and Breckenridge and Bell only in the Southern states.
	 Lincoln won a plurality (39 percent) of the popular vote, and a clear majority
	 (59 percent) of the electoral vote. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="#990000"><B>"The Man
	 Who Doesn't Vote" by Austin Abbott, 1860<BR></B>Newberry Library: oE 415.7 .P55
	 no. 1-23</FONT><BR>"The citizen who does not vote is a faithless trustee,"
	 Austin Abbott proclaims in an attempt to stimulate voter participation for a
	 contentious election. While voter turnout rates wre significantly higher for
	 mid-nineteenth century elections than late-twentieth century ones (81.2 percent
	 in 1860 to 51 percent in 2000), many groups were excluded from formally
	 participating in the political system. Women and African Americans were
	 generally restricted from the polls. According to Abbott, however, this did not
	 mean that their interests went unrepresented. Instead, men were entrusted to
	 speak for the interests of their dependents. In this tract, Abbott admonishes
	 the man who does not fulfill his responsibility to the civic body.<BR>

	 1888 Union Party Ticket, [1865-67]</B><BR>Newberry Library: Midwest MS
	 Harrison, Box 21, Folder 1094</FONT><BR>In the nineteenth century, political
	 parties controlled the procedural process of voting. Voters typically choose a
	 "ticket"-a single piece of paper listing all of a party's candidates-from a
	 party representative and placed it into the ballot box often in full view of
	 their peers. The Union Party ticket demonstrates the stylized nature of some of
	 these ballots. The tickets for Grover Cleveland date from his successful bid
	 for president in 1884 and his failure in 1888, when he won the popular vote but
	 lost in the Electoral College. In the 1890s, local and state governments began
	 to take a greater responsibility for elections and produced ballots that
	 allowed voters to choose amongst candidates from different parties in different
	 races on a single piece of paper and in private. <BR><BR> <FONT

	 Book of the Democratic Party of the United States</I></B><BR>Chicago: Western
	 Newspaper Union, 1908<BR>Newberry Library: 4A 5055</FONT><BR>By taking a
	 cartoon from <I>Puck</I> and adding the title "Object Lesson of Republican
	 Rule," the Democratic Party argues that the bulldog of monopoly will relegate
	 the mutts to the scraps. Although Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was
	 known as the "trust buster" and his handpicked successor William Howard Taft
	 claimed he would continue these policies, Democrats did not believe Roosevelt
	 had gone far enough to balance the needs of business with those of the common
	 man. In his acceptance speech, Democratic nominee Williams Jennings Bryan
	 promised if elected to "assure to each the enjoyment of his just share of the
	 proceeeds of his toil, no matter in what part of the vineyard he labors, or to
	 what occupation, profession or calling he devotes himself." Taft won the
	 election.<BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="#990000"><B>Harry Evans, <I>Will Rogers for
	 President</I></B><BR>New York: <I>Life, </I>Publishing Co., 1928<BR>Newberry
	 Library: Driscoll Box 160, H&amp;P Related Presidential</FONT><BR>Popular
	 celebrities sometimes find themselves called upon to public duty. Will Rogers,
	 "the Indian cowboy, the white man in blackface, [and] the millionaire
	 spokesperson for the common man," found himself in such a position in 1928.
	 Unsatisfied with Herbert Hoover and Al Smith, in sincere jest Life magazine
	 nominated Rogers for president. The song lyrics claim, "he'll do just what he
	 oughter, for the farmer and his daughter." Rogers responded by promising to do
	 only one thing if elected, resign. He did agree, however, to write a weekly
	 column providing sardonic musings on the mainstream campaigns.<BR> <BR>

	 1932?</I></B><BR>Boston: Music Service Company, 1931<BR>Newberry Library:
	 Driscoll Box 160, H&amp;P Related Presidential</FONT><BR>John H. Trayne set his
	 critique of Herbert Hoover's administration to music, asking in refrain "what's
	 the Republican Party doing for you?" The Great Depression began in 1929 during
	 Hoover's administration, and by 1932 almost one-quarter of the workforce was
	 jobless. Public reactions to Hoover's strategies of response varies from anger
	 to disappointment. Trayne's song expressed disillusionment wit the current
	 administration: "they surely loaded us with bunk...we've had too many wandering
	 commissions...they promised work but gave us intermission." The public seemed
	 to agree with the line "we need a change," electing Franklin D. Roosevelt as
	 president and giving the Democrats majority control in the House and
	 Senate.</P>

	 Driscoll Box 160, H&amp;P Related Presidential</FONT><BR>Women Workers for
	 Willkie set their rally songs to popular tunes. The songs echo Willkie's
	 central campaign issue, the nation's continuing economic troubles. Despite
	 seven years of New Deal legislation, almost ten million workers were still
	 jobless in 1939. The lyrics accuse Roosevelt of overburdening the common man
	 with his spendthrift policies. This message apparently did not catch on, as
	 Roosevelt demonstratively defeated of Willkie in both the popular and electoral
	 vote.</P>

	 2048</FONT><BR>Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency through tragedy and
	 despite his distinguished congressional record he was uncertain whether he
	 would be elected on his own merits in 1964. His opponent, Senator Barry
	 Goldwater, ran a grassroots campaign that appealed to conservatives but
	 alienated more mainstream Republicans. Goldwater advocated surrendering federal
	 oversight for domestic social program to private enterprise. He also approved
	 of the use of nuclear weapons. Goldwater used the slogan "In Your Heart, You
	 Know He's Right," which Johnson supporters twisted to say "In Your Guts, You
	 Know He's Nuts." This public petition by leaders in law, medicine, academics,
	 and the arts community indicates the level of distrust of Goldwater amongst
	 Republicans in the Chicago metropolitan area.<BR><BR> <BR> <BR> </P>
