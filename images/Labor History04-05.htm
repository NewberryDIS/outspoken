  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="-1">Nineteenth-century prisons were not enclosed
  systems of total surveillance, as argued by Michel Foucault and others.
  Penitentiaries were dynamic institutions with their own internal world that
  inmates and prison officials structured and shaped in their own ways in
  dramatic contrast to the original goals of penitentiary reformers. This essay
  offers a case study of nineteenth-century male imprisonment and attempts to
  move beyond "the creed and deed" treatment of prison history emphasizing the
  impact of reformers and administrators. Focusing upon Sing Sing, arguably the
  most famous penitentiary in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century United
  States, reveals a hidden history of how convicts, keepers, guards, contractors
  and prison officials shaped punishment. Rather than looking at the prison from
  the outside in, I want to present a vision from the inside
  out.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><I></I></FONT> <B><FONT SIZE="-1">December

  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="-1">A work in progress, "Sex and the Motor City"
  will explore the "bachelor culture" as it emerged in the rapid growth of
  industrial Detroit from the 1900s through the 1930s. In the 1910s and 1920s
  especially, the motor city attracted large numbers of young and single men to
  staff the machines and the assembly lines of the new automobile industry. Upon
  their arrival in Detroit, these often single men of the "suitcase brigade"
  became involved with the social institutions of a male bachelor culture. "Sex
  and the Motor City" will specifically examine those sexualized spaces and
  places associated with this male culture.<BR><I></I></FONT><BR><FONT

  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper examines how labor and religion
  shaped the Mexican experience of race in Chicago in the wake of the Mexican
  Revolution. Between 1910 and 1929 an estimated one million Mexicans - one
  eighth to one tenth of Mexico's population - migrated to the United States to
  escape the violence, unrest, and religious persecution of the Mexican
  Revolution. Those coming to Chicago entered the steel, meat-packing and
  railroad industries as well as the domain of the Archdiocese of Chicago. I
  examine how Mexicans were racialized in the workplace as well as in the
  communities in which they lived and woshiped. I suggest that as at least
  nominal Catholics, Mexicans had access to a wider range of neighborhoods than
  Blacks did at the time though they were racialized similarly in the
  workplace.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>
