	  <h1>The Encyclopedia of Chicago </h1>
	  
	  
	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p>The Newberry Library lies across the street from Bughouse
	  Square. The unofficial but commonly used name of this small
	  park evokes its long association with the unconventional and
	  the marginal: soapbox orators, prostitutes, cultural
	  nonconformists, and, by the 1980s, homeless men on park
	  benches. In the mid-1990s, on the other side of the square
	  block of cement paths, meager grass, and shade trees, a
	  developer demolished the old Salvation Army office building,
	  revived the park’s official name, and successfully
	  advertised luxury residences facing “Washington Square
	  Park”—which now sports a decorative wrought-iron fence and
	  attractive fountain. Like his New York City counterpart who
	  created a neighborhood called “Clinton” where once was a
	  space called “Hell’s Kitchen,” this entrepreneur understood
	  the malleability and power of place names. This might sound
	  benign—a matter of neighborhood improvement and private
	  profit at the expense of tradition, local color, and the
	  sensibilities of neighborhood old-timers—but often there is
	  much at stake in how a space is named. Names are tied up
	  with boundaries, and groups contesting for turf often name
	  overlapping spaces differently to stake their claims.</p>
	  <p>The Encyclopedia of Chicago is a mapping of Chicago’s
	  geographic turf, complemented by a comparable cartography of
	  boundaries that are more conceptual and topical than
	  spatial. Imagine a map that has been broken up into puzzle
	  pieces, each of which is an identifiable unit of some kind:
	  each encyclopedia entry represents a piece of that
	  puzzle. The piece looks the way it does because of the
	  context in which it was created: each entry was generated
	  within a particular rubric (e.g., reform, public order,
	  literature). Like a city space, an entry’s use can be shaped
	  by the process by which its boundaries and its name were
	  determined.. The editor’s power resembles the developer’s,
	  and the encyclopedia as a whole—the combination of the
	  pieces—represents an editorial interpretation of urban
	  history.</p>
	  <h2>Metropolitan History</h2>
	  <p>The editors of The Encyclopedia of Chicago began with a
	  commitment to a vision of a metropolitan area whose past,
	  present, and future rest on the principle of
	  interdependence. Seemingly disparate strands and isolated
	  pockets of metropolitan life are best understood as part of
	  an integrated whole, and within broad regional, national,
	  and international contexts. Robert Park’s oft-quoted
	  metaphor of the city as “a mosaic of little worlds that
	  touch but do not interpenetrate” is more intuitive than
	  accurate. In Chicago, “Little Italy” and “Greektown” not
	  only touched but deeply interpenetrated, most obviously
	  because residents of these districts and other nearby
	  immigrant neighborhoods passed one another on the street,
	  perhaps attending similar events at Hull House, or the same
	  public schools. Less obviously, but equally important, the
	  historical processes that shaped the lives of these
	  residents were anything but separate. The Gold Coast cannot
	  exist without the slum; the suburb is by definition a place
	  with a relationship to the city.</p>
	  <p>This commitment to an integrative urban history exists in
	  tension with the nature of the publication itself:
	  structurally, an encyclopedia is a fragmented genre. There
	  is no single narrative. An analytical structure that depends
	  on a reader working through the material in a particular
	  order is impossible. But The Encyclopedia of Chicago is more
	  than a reference book comprising discrete frames of
	  information about individual topics. It represents a
	  synthesis of a century of scholarship in urban history in
	  general and on Chicago in particular. It is also the result
	  of a process influenced by the simultaneous creation of an
	  electronic encyclopedia, which places a premium on thinking
	  about links, structure, and the malleability of
	  categories.</p>
	  <p>The encyclopedia’s conceptualization started with
	  geographical space because this is a work of urban
	  history. An ambitious goal was set to move beyond the
	  shifting boundaries of the city to create a metropolitan
	  history. This means more than a narrative of a fixed space
	  encompassing Chicago and its collar counties. It requires an
	  interpretive emphasis on the historical dynamics of
	  metropolitan dependence and interaction. City and
	  countryside, sometimes placed in opposition as artifice
	  versus nature, are both artifacts of human creativity, and
	  this encyclopedia begins with the assumption that the
	  history of a metropolis includes not only central city and
	  bedroom suburbs, but also the industrial towns, agricultural
	  centers, and vacation spots that dot its broad
	  landscape. The Burnham Plan extended 60 miles beyond the
	  Loop, not because Daniel Burnham and the Commercial Club
	  were metropolitan imperialists (and they may have been), but
	  because it was clear even in 1909 that a Plan of Chicago
	  couldn’t stop at the city boundaries. Nor can an
	  encyclopedia that is both a work of urban history and a
	  comprehensive reference. The problem of spatial definition
	  involves relationships among time, space, and
	  culture. Municipal boundaries change over time; the
	  metropolitan area as a cultural and social entity (and even
	  as an idea) invariably encompasses a territory that
	  transcends physical and political boundaries. Moreover, a
	  place with a diverse population acquires over the years
	  equally diverse understandings of its spaces. Such
	  diversity, of course, is one of Chicago’s defining
	  characteristics. Therefore a project with aspirations to
	  define the city historically must somehow find a way to use
	  diversity as a founding principle. The challenge lies in
	  recognizing that diversity does not preclude the centrality
	  of the idea of civic culture, or the interpretive goal of
	  using the city as a venue for synthetic narrative and
	  analysis.</p>
	  <p>This encyclopedia is intended to serve as a comprehensive
	  reference work for members of the general public, for
	  secondary school students as well as scholars of urban
	  history, for lifelong residents of the Chicago area as well
	  as visitors. Beyond the boundaries of the city’s
	  neighborhoods and the region’s municipalities, Chicago’s
	  history has been significant in many ways for American and
	  even world culture. Readers expecting coverage of
	  skyscrapers and blues music, for example, will find a wealth
	  of relevant entries. The range of topics in the encyclopedia
	  includes architecture, music, literature, the arts,
	  politics, reform movements, social services, health, public
	  order, religion, immigration, housing, public works, labor,
	  and leisure. This expansive agenda for a single volume with
	  a stable binding and text that can be read without a
	  magnifying glass has combined with the editors’ interpretive
	  perspective and their emphasis on integrative historical
	  scholarship to shape the contours of what we have included
	  in this book.</p>
	  <h2>Balancing Breadth and Detail</h2>
	  <p>The central tension in a work that seeks to combine
	  encyclopedic detail with integrative analysis lies in the
	  principle of “lumping” versus “splitting.” To split is to
	  privilege detail, to amass entries that permit users to
	  learn the essential facts of as many historical phenomena as
	  possible. Each institution has its own history, each
	  community its own portrait, each individual her or his own
	  biography. To lump is to allot higher priority to analysis
	  and comparison, to emphasize relationships, to integrate
	  subject matter within entries more than through
	  cross-referencing. This project’s interpretive emphasis on
	  the integrative nature of urban life is balanced with its
	  goal of providing comprehensive reference: what matters,
	  therefore, is where we lump and where we split.</p>
	  <p> The most extensive splitting, yielding the largest
	  proportion of the entries, lies in the areas that will draw
	  the initial attention of most users: who we are and where we
	  live. Ethnicity and residence are, more often than not, the
	  mental maps that help Chicagoans situate themselves in the
	  metropolis. To present Chicago’s history as it has been
	  experienced and understood by Chicagoans requires
	  comprehensive coverage of these orientations. Hence all 298
	  incorporated municipalities in Cook, DuPage, McHenry, Lake,
	  Will, and Kane Counties in Illinois, and Lake and Porter
	  Counties in Indiana, have entries, along with six
	  communities beyond these boundaries. To assure complete
	  geographic coverage of the central city, we selected as a
	  starting point the 77 community areas that Chicago city
	  government and social scientists employ as units of
	  analysis. But because the people who live in these spaces
	  often define their communities in different terms (and
	  sometimes with different boundaries), we also commissioned
	  shorter entries on particular neighborhoods. These 33
	  neighborhoods, identified by the authors of community-area
	  entries as named spaces with cultural and social staying
	  power, overlap geographically with community areas and
	  represent only a selection of places that Chicagoans have
	  defined as neighborhoods. Some readers will not find an
	  entry under the name that they use to define their community
	  (e.g., Edgebrook, Wrigleyville, the Gap), although such a
	  name is likely to be found in the index. All residents of
	  metropolitan Chicago will find at least one entry on the
	  geographical area that they call home. A broader perspective
	  is presented in the entry “Growth of the Metropolis,” which
	  emphasizes the mutual dependence and interrelated histories
	  that individual entries on geographic spaces are by their
	  very nature bound to obscure.</p>
	  <p>A similar dilemma presents itself with regard to ethnic
	  groups. Like neighborhoods, ethnic boundaries are
	  ever-shifting and nearly infinite. A Calabrian arrives in
	  Chicago and gradually becomes an Italian. A Jewish immigrant
	  from Russia is a “Russian” in the census but a Jew in most
	  other contexts. Lakota migrants from South Dakota to Chicago
	  inhabit a community that describes itself as Native
	  American, but they are likely to continue to identify with
	  their Lakota community back home. Some Mexican Americans
	  consider themselves “Latinos”; others identify more with
	  Mexican heritage than with experiences shared by people from
	  Central and South America. An Iraqi American is also an Arab
	  American. The census offers no solution, as it shifts from
	  decade to decade in the options provided for ethnic
	  identification. Facing the challenge of infinite and
	  overlapping categories, we have chosen to rely on current
	  national boundaries to define the scope and naming of
	  entries on ethnic groups. The cost is obvious: an entry
	  called “Germans” ignores the fact that thousands of Germans
	  came to Chicago before there was a Germany. Language is not
	  the defining characteristic, because Austrians have a
	  separate entry. Arab Americans, many of whom identify in
	  just that way, are split into Egyptians, Saudis, Syrians,
	  and so on. Moreover, Chicago’s significant
	  early-twentieth-century Syrian community actually was
	  composed of people we now call Lebanese Christians. Finally,
	  some exceptions could not be avoided; else there would be no
	  entries on Jews, African Americans, southern white migrants,
	  Welsh, or Yankees.</p>
	  <p>This definitional strategy does not, however, resolve the
	  question of whom to include. Who is here and who isn’t? Or,
	  more precisely, who has been here and who hasn’t? Numbers
	  alone as criteria for inclusion are insufficient and
	  ahistorical: a community of one thousand in 1845 had an
	  impact on local culture very different from a community of a
	  thousand in the 1990s. But therein lies the solution: a
	  community. What makes a community? This seemingly eternal
	  debate invites no easy answer, and the editors had already
	  sidestepped it by using official designations for entries on
	  suburban municipalities and Chicago community areas. To
	  locate ethnic presence, the editors drew on the observation
	  that every community study in the field of urban history has
	  an obligatory section on institution-building. Hence, any
	  given ethnic group has “been here” if they have built an
	  institution—any institution. New Zealanders have a rugby
	  club. Some groups with small numbers have clubs oriented
	  toward political questions back home. Restaurants count only
	  if they are gathering places on some regular basis, such as
	  the Argo Georgian Bakery on Devon Avenue. On this basis
	  encyclopedia staff located 146 ethnic groups in
	  Chicago. Each has an entry.</p>
	  <p>Religion proved even more difficult. There is no
	  equivalent to current national boundaries. What would be the
	  threshold for a denomination, or a sect? Here we have chosen
	  to lump groups together rather than split them
	  apart. Lumping allows our authors to weave a more complex
	  story of religious development than they could in an endless
	  series of short pieces on an infinite number of religious
	  entities. Readers looking for histories of Methodists,
	  Lutherans, or Assemblies of God should go to the entry on
	  Protestants. The encyclopedia includes entries on Ba’hai,
	  Buddhists, Eastern Orthodox, Hindus, Jews, Mormons, Muslims,
	  Protestants, Roman Catholics, Sikhs, and Zoroastrians. The
	  stories of individual denominations, sects, and
	  congregations have taken a back seat to broader themes in
	  the history of religion in metropolitan Chicago. These
	  themes include a complex and shifting religious geography,
	  and the region’s substantial influence on national and
	  international religious thought and trends. But the book
	  also maps the area’s vast matrix of religious institutions,
	  which has infused nearly every aspect of local culture. The
	  entry “Religious Institutions,” for example, is less about
	  churches, synagogues, or mosques than about the many ways in
	  which Chicago’s faith communities have provided services and
	  generated cultural development.</p>
	  <p>The problem of where to tell a particular story is hardly
	  limited to entries that navigate the difficult waters of
	  identity. Every category of institutional life raised the
	  question of when to weave together many stories into a
	  synthetic narrative and when to present single strands on
	  their own. Museums, colleges and universities, architectural
	  styles, leisure activities, political organizations,
	  corporations: each could yield an almost infinite set of
	  narrow entries, or a very small set of broad essays covering
	  vast territory. Our integrative approach generated a skew
	  toward the larger picture. Extended essays on such issues as
	  politics, art, work, and leisure offer narrative and
	  analytical frameworks that both mention significant
	  institutions and events and establish contexts for narrower
	  topics covered in shorter entries. Sometimes our strategy
	  grew out of practical considerations. For example, it is
	  possible to identify a satisfactory (if not absolutely
	  comprehensive) list of the generally recognized, accredited,
	  postsecondary educational institutions. Hence each four-year
	  college and university is covered in its own entry (with
	  apologies to the one that we have undoubtedly missed), while
	  “Universities and Their Cities” tells a broad
	  story. Schools, on the other hand, are so numerous that
	  individual entries would be impossible. They are treated
	  together in an essay that maps the evolution of Chicago’s
	  school systems. Professional sports teams receive individual
	  coverage; they are limited in number and have readily
	  bounded histories. The stories of other athletic landscapes,
	  such as school, sandlot, and collegiate sports, are told
	  through the more generalized mechanism of entries on
	  individual sports. In contrast to health, where the story is
	  told largely through institutional contexts, music divides
	  more logically by genre. Architecture provided still a
	  different set of issues, given Chicago’s vast landscape of
	  significant buildings, trends, and innovations. Each of
	  these important aspects of Chicago’s architectural history
	  has received attention, but readers looking for the larger
	  architectural picture, and for the many significant
	  particulars that did not receive individual attention, can
	  turn to the four overview essays that periodize Chicago’s
	  architectural history (“Architecture”), and a wide-ranging
	  survey entitled “Places of Assembly.”</p>
	  <p>Businesses posed a distinct challenge, given the
	  thousands of enterprises that have generated commerce in
	  metropolitan Chicago. Here again, coverage is both detailed
	  and broadly contextual. Our solution was driven by the urge
	  to be as comprehensive as possible as well as by the
	  encyclopedia’s general orientation toward categorical
	  analysis and broader context. Significant sectors of the
	  regional economy (e.g., iron and steel, meatpacking,
	  chemicals, agriculture) are treated in broad narrative
	  entries, with particular attention to the most dominant
	  companies. A Dictionary of Leading Chicago Businesses, which
	  appears as an appendix, includes 236 companies chosen
	  because of national importance, particular significance to
	  metropolitan Chicago, number of employees, or a special
	  Chicago angle. Relative brevity and smaller print have
	  permitted inclusion of far more enterprises than could have
	  been accommodated as regular A-Z entries.</p>
	  <p>Biography posed an even greater dilemma. A list of the
	  iconic figures who stand astride major themes in Chicago’s
	  history, augmented by compilations of famous people in
	  various fields, yielded a list too extensive to include in a
	  volume oriented toward metropolitan integration, comparison,
	  and context—unless these were limited to 250 words or
	  less. What could our readers learn in 200 words about Frank
	  Lloyd Wright or Jane Addams that they could not readily find
	  in dozens of reference books with local or national
	  orientations, including the definitive multivolume and
	  recently revised American National Biography (1999)? Very
	  little. Meanwhile, some of the greatest lacunae in the
	  standard biographical dictionaries were already being filled
	  by Women Building Chicago, 1790-1990: A Biographical
	  Dictionary (2001). The encyclopedia’s reference function
	  could be better served by providing information about
	  individuals who often were relatively obscure, but whose
	  significance is marked by the decision of one or more
	  authors to include them in an entry. The result is a
	  Biographical Dictionary, which includes all deceased
	  individuals mentioned in this volume in the context of
	  activities relating directly to Chicago. Thomas Jefferson,
	  for example, is mentioned in an entry but is not in this
	  dictionary; by contrast, Martin Luther King, Jr., is
	  included because his name emerges in the context of his
	  civil rights activism in Chicago. This approach required new
	  research, which enabled us to provide basic data for 2,191
	  individuals, including dates and places of birth and death
	  and a note about each person’s significance to Chicago
	  history.</p>
	  <p>The other main elements of this book, in addition to the
	  standard encyclopedia entries and the dictionary
	  compilations, are blind entries, interpretive essays,
	  sidebars, a chronological survey of Chicago history in the
	  form of a timeline and “year pages,” cross-references, maps,
	  illustrations, tables and statistical appendixes, and an
	  index. Like the standard entries, each of these elements
	  contributes to the aim of creating an integrative history,
	  and each has been prepared either by the editors themselves
	  or by scholars participating in the project.</p>
	  <h2>Elements of the Encyclopedia</h2>
	  <p>The Encyclopedia of Chicago consists of three types of
	  standard entries: broad essays, mid-level entries, and basic
	  entries. Broad essays offer scaffolding for a large topic—a
	  starting point for readers who want an overview of, for
	  example, dance, public health, or transportation. Most of
	  these have straightforward titles, but some attempt to pull
	  together disparate strands of material in a way that
	  produces less obvious titles, such as “Places of Assembly.”
	  Readers will be guided to these articles by blind entries
	  appearing where readers might expect to find more narrowly
	  construed but traditional titles like “Stadiums” or
	  “Convention Centers.” (A blind entry is alphabetized like a
	  regular entry but, in place of any accompanying text,
	  directs readers to another entry or entries where that topic
	  is discussed comprehensively.) All broad essays are at least
	  1,000 words, some reaching as high as 4,000. At the other
	  extreme lie the basic entries. These focus on a specific
	  event, institution, or comparable phenomenon (e.g.,
	  Haymarket and May Day, La Leche League, Mr. Wizard, Soldier
	  Field). Most of these are relatively brief, often under 200
	  words. Major institutions, however, such as the Art
	  Institute of Chicago, receive more extensive coverage. In
	  between the broad entries and basic entries lie the
	  mid-level entries. These perform two functions: they fill in
	  gaps left by broad essays that could not cover the entire
	  terrain of a topic, and they provide context and sometimes
	  comparative analysis for topics covered in basic
	  entries. “Universities and Their Cities,” for example,
	  surveys the landscape of postsecondary education, offering
	  an overview of individual institutions that have only very
	  brief individual entries. In some cases basic entries were
	  omitted in favor of the larger view possible in mid-level
	  entries. For example, “Amusement Parks” covers the territory
	  in lieu of entries on Riverview, Joyland Park, and Great
	  America. In general the editors have chosen “forests” over
	  “trees” for entries, and readers who do not find specific
	  entries can use the index to locate contextualized
	  discussions of these topics.</p>
	  <p>Two types of entries serve less conventional encyclopedia
	  functions. Authors of the 21 interpretive essays were asked
	  to reflect on recent scholarship rather than provide
	  comprehensive topical or chronological coverage. “Creation
	  of Chicago Sports,” for example, highlights particular
	  themes that explain the shift from nineteenth-century
	  sporting culture to the spectator orientation that emerged
	  by the 1920s. Although this essay ends with a landscape that
	  will seem familiar to modern readers, it offers little
	  information about developments since the 1920s; the
	  interpretive edge of the questions it explores was sharpest
	  during the preceding century. Because they are intended to
	  adapt the insights of current scholarship to broad issues in
	  Chicago history, thereby also indirectly introducing readers
	  to this scholarship, these essays include substantial
	  bibliographical essays rather than the standard listing of
	  up to three recommendations for further reading. A notable
	  exception is “Chicago Studied: Social Scientists and Their
	  City,” which weaves its bibliography into the article itself
	  as it explains the use and influence of Chicago as an urban
	  laboratory. Because of their interpretive focus and their
	  more free-ranging orientation, many interpretive essays have
	  titles that are less than obvious. Blind entries at the more
	  obvious points guide readers to this scholarship. “Creation
	  of Chicago Sports” is not topically or chronologically
	  comprehensive enough to be called “Sports”; a reader who
	  looks up “Sports” will be directed to this entry
	  instead. Interpretive essays are indicated by a special icon
	  preceding their titles.</p>
	  <p>Sidebars, also liberated from the obligation of
	  encyclopedic coverage, serve different purposes, offering
	  perspectives either supplementary or complementary to those
	  presented in the entries with which they appear. Voices of
	  participants in major events and a handful of biographies
	  lend a personal perspective to the related entry’s
	  narrative. Other sidebars establish a conversation with
	  their related entry, suggesting an alternative perspective
	  or pointing to additional implications. Sidebars are neither
	  cross-referenced nor accompanied by bibliographies because
	  their close association with an entry would in most cases
	  have produced redundant references. To make it into the
	  encyclopedia, each sidebar had to relate to other entries in
	  addition to the one it accompanies.</p>
	  <p>This linkage requirement pertained to all entries. Any
	  issue so isolated historically that it could not generate a
	  cross-reference to another entry does not meet this
	  encyclopedia’s test of historical significance. Influenced
	  in part by the anticipation of subsequent electronic
	  publication which will permit alternative modes of
	  navigation dependent on comprehensive and imaginative
	  cross-referencing, the process of designating links was
	  accorded a high priority. These links fall into two
	  categories: cross-references within the text of an entry
	  (presented in SMALL CAPITALS) and “see also” references at
	  the end of each entry. In some cases entries were selected
	  or conceptualized in part by how they would fit into a
	  larger set of linked articles. The editors identified these
	  links as they read entries, with an eye toward gently
	  nudging readers to appreciate historical relationships that
	  are more interpretive than obvious. Most mid-level and basic
	  entries link “upward” to broad essays. As often as possible
	  the editors have linked an entry to at least one
	  interpretive essay.</p>
	  <p>The links (i.e., cross-references and “see also’s”)
	  generate pathways through the encyclopedia, suggesting to
	  readers the various ways in which the editors might fit
	  together pieces of the puzzle. The sheer number of these
	  links creates an almost infinite series of pathways, so in
	  the end readers who spend considerable time working their
	  way through the encyclopedia will work the puzzle in a
	  variety of ways, each of which will generate a different map
	  of metropolitan history. In one case, the editors have
	  themselves drawn the map: a timeline. Appearing in a special
	  color insert, the timeline charts Chicago’s history for the
	  same period covered by the entries: from glaciation to the
	  opening of the twenty-first century. It highlights major
	  events and processes, including those that took place over
	  many years.</p>
	  <p>The timeline is complemented by a series of year pages,
	  which, using a combination of images, documents, maps, and
	  texts, encourage readers to consider how events, people,
	  institutions, and processes came together at particular
	  moments in Chicago’s history. The reasons for the choice of
	  some of the years—such as 1871, the year of the Great
	  Chicago Fire—will be immediately apparent. The significance
	  of other selections, such as 1937, the year of the Memorial
	  Day Massacre, might be less intuitive. Each year page,
	  however, provides a window into what it meant to be in
	  Chicago during a year in which the city experienced
	  substantial change.</p>
	  <p>These chronologically oriented elements of the
	  encyclopedia are skewed toward the last two centuries of
	  Chicago’s evolution. As a work of urban history, this
	  encyclopedia is oriented toward aspects of the metropolitan
	  area’s development that signify its formation as an urban
	  place. Yet Chicago’s history does not begin with its
	  incorporation as a town in 1833. Even where an entry’s
	  narrative begins in the 1830s or just before, we have
	  resisted suggesting that the local history of politics,
	  dance, public health, art, or any other aspect of community
	  life “began” at that time. Similarly, the encyclopedia
	  eschews references to people who arrived in the 1830s or
	  1840s as “pioneers.” By the middle of the nineteenth century
	  American Indians had settled, lived, and worked in the area
	  for centuries, some groups staying for generations before
	  moving on to another location. Arriving in what would
	  eventually become Crete, Illinois, in 1836, Willard and
	  Diantha Wood can be identified as that area’s first
	  landowners; but they were centuries too late to be
	  considered “early settlers.”</p>
	  <p>This concern with the history of population and land use
	  has received special attention in the encyclopedia’s
	  maps. The maps stem from no mere decorative impulse, but
	  rather seek to communicate vital features of the urban
	  community’s embeddedness in physical space and the unique
	  configurations of place that this has produced over
	  time. The cartography falls into three categories: thematic
	  maps and “thumbnails,” newly drawn for this publication, and
	  existing (mainly historical) maps. The thumbnail maps
	  accompany entries on locations and enable readers to situate
	  a place within the metropolitan area. Readers of all entries
	  can refer to the “Metropolitan Chicago Reference Map” that
	  follows this Introduction for spatial orientation and an
	  overview of the metropolitan area. The existing maps serve
	  either as illustrations suggesting how space was perceived
	  at a particular time, or as resources that the editors
	  considered sufficient to the encyclopedia’s cartographic
	  imperatives and therefore publishable in their original
	  form. In most cases, however, both the reference and
	  interpretive agendas of the project required the creation of
	  new maps, all of which grew out of a careful process of
	  conceptualization, research, visual design, and scholarly
	  review overseen by the cartographic editor. Topics found in
	  map legends and captions are indexed but are not
	  cross-referenced. The cartography in general suggests new
	  ways of looking at space, time, people, institutions, and
	  historical processes in metropolitan Chicago.</p>
	  <h2>Mapping the Future</h2>
	  <p>American Historical Association president Lynn Hunt
	  observed in 2002 that the many recently published
	  encyclopedias “usually represent a summing up of what has
	  been accomplished rather than a forging forward.” This book
	  is intended instead to be both a platform for moving forward
	  and part of the process of moving forward. Like most
	  reference books it rests on a foundation of work generated
	  by many scholars over many years. But it also has required
	  substantial new research. Project staff found scores of
	  immigrant groups that had begun to establish themselves in
	  Chicago and other American cities but had not yet drawn the
	  attention of scholars. These entries demanded not only
	  primary research but also fieldwork; their lack of
	  bibliographical citations signals a scarcity of published
	  sources. Even more striking is the thin historiography on
	  Chicago’s suburbs. Most of the entries on suburban
	  municipalities required considerable digging into primary
	  sources and local histories. In addition, many other entries
	  reflect the imbalance in current scholarship between studies
	  of city and suburb, suggesting the vast territory that
	  remains to be explored. Historians have, for instance,
	  written many fine books on the history of policing in
	  American cities, and a literature has also begun to emerge
	  on firefighting. Research on these activities in suburban
	  communities is at best scarce. The same could be said for a
	  wide variety of topics, from art to machine politics to work
	  culture. Innumerable entries, drawing on slivers of existing
	  scholarship and forays into primary sources, invite further
	  scholarly attention, especially within a metropolitan
	  frame. More than just an expansion of attention beyond the
	  city, metropolitan history demands attention to questions of
	  interdependence that not only have influenced the past but
	  also will shape the future. The editors hope that this
	  publication will whet rather than satisfy the curiosity of
	  its readers, thereby stimulating new research, not just on
	  Chicago but other cities as well.</p>
