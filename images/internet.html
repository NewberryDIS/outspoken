					 interviewed were centenarians, the oldest being 130 at the time of the
					 interview. The almost seven hours of recordings were made in nine Southern
					 states and provide an important glimpse of what life was like for slaves and
					 freedmen. The former slaves discuss how they felt about slavery, slaveholders,
					 how slaves were coerced, their families, and, of course, freedom. It is
					 important to keep in mind, however, that all of those interviewed spoke sixty
					 or more years after the end of their enslavement, and it is their full lives,
					 rather than their lives during slavery, that are reflected in their words. They
					 have much to say about living as African Americans from the 1870s to the 1930s,
