	 Professsional Development Program</I><BR>The nation's third largest school
	 district will collaborate with the Chicago Historical Society, Chicago Metro
	 History Education Center, Constitutional Rights Foundation Chicago, the
	 Newberry Library, the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, and the
	 University of Illinois at Chicago to improve skills, raise student achievement,
	 and create professional communities among history teachers in grades 7-12.
	 Teachers from nearby middle and high schools are organized into 4-member
	 professional development teams for intensive summer institutes, in-service
	 colloquia, and programs featuring project partner resources. Institutes address
	 political, social, cultural and economic themes reflected in initial encounters
	 between American Indians and Europeans through the current era of
	 globalization. Colloquia mix small group work with presentations on such topics
	 as the Northwest Ordinance and Constitutional Convention of 1787, slavery, the
	 Civil War and Reconstruction, progressivism and the labor movement, the New
	 Deal, and the civil rights movement. Designed to develop teachers as scholars
	 and reflective practitioners, the project extends to non-participating schools
	 and works to create master teachers for leadership roles. </P> 
	 <P>2004 Teaching American History Grant<BR>Chicago Public Schools -
	 $1,213,290<BR>Project: <I>Connecting with American History Project</I><BR>In
	 cooperation with the Newberry Library, Chicago Historical Society, Chicago
	 Metro History Education Center, Constitutional Rights Foundation Chicago, and
	 DuSable Museum of African American History, the project immerses 10th grade
	 American History teachers in a series of professional development activities
	 designed to increase teaching skills and content knowledge. Content focuses on
	 significant defining moments of five seminal periods of traditional U.S.
	 history: From Revolution to New Nation; Reconstruction of American Citizenship;
	 Nation of Immigrants; Depression, War, and the State; and America's Second
	 Reconstruction. Participants use Quarterly Planning Maps combined with
	 benchmark assessments to align instructional skills with student progress. The
	 program integrates traditional delivery methods - symposia, institutes,
	 seminars and workshops - with "reform activities" including study groups,
	 collaborative curriculum development, action research, and coaching.<BR> </P>
