	 SIZE="+1"><FONT SIZE="-1">The health demands of the Great Depression called for
	 close cooperation between the helping professions and many scientific
	 disciplines. In particular, rural health nursing in this period embraced a
	 spirit of sympathetic help within the broader framework of American health
	 policy. Decrying the "heartless ostracism" of an earlier age, rural health
	 nurses conceived of the public's health as a complex, interconnected whole -
	 and themselves as the essential lubricant in an integrated health care machine.
	 I will argue that this configuration of rural nursing as comprehensive,
	 adjunctive care-giving left its practitioners determinately dependent on other
	 experts for identity.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	 some of the key intersections between changes in medicine and the stresses
	 placed on public responsibility to provide for the very poor. My essay outlines
	 provisions for medical care provided by Iowa's county-based systems for poor
	 relief and the ways that local physicians negotiated this tax-funded medical
	 service in a predominately rural state. Through the examples I offer, I
	 illustrate the importance of research into county-level medical services and

	 tax-supported health care before World War

	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper examines African American
	 medical care and its multi-layered cultural resonances in the antebellum United
	 States. Often two or more systems competed for control and trust in terms of
	 treating slaves' bodies. African American folk-healers leveraged a knowledge of
	 folk medicine into a kind of spiritual authority. Alongside this system slave
	 owners, who had their own interest in keeping slaves sound, imposed various
	 medical regimens. Meanwhile in the North, abolitionists seized on the physical
	 and sexual torments that slaves' bodies endured. Their own anxieties about the
	 ill-health of European immigrants crowded into burgeoning Northern cities and
	 their doubts about where the provision of medical care fit into a
	 free-wage-labor economic system complicated their rhetoric about slaves'
	 health. An understanding of slaves' medical care must take into account these
	 competing idelogies and practices as they related to African American sickness
	 and health.</FONT><B></B></P><HR>

	 SIZE="+1"><FONT SIZE="-1">In the late-nineteenth century, the rural women and
	 men who subscribed to the sex radical weekly <I>Luciver, the Light-Bearer
	 </I>shared a commitment to freedom of expression and an interest in the sexual
	 emancipation of women. Using print as a medium through which they could assert
	 a conscious identification of themselves as aligned with one another and
	 separate from mainstream groups, <I>Lucifer's </I>geographically isolated and
	 culturally alienated readers transformed that publication into a venue for
	 debate and discussion. In this paper, which draws upon published letters and
	 census records, I adopt a reader-centered approach to explore the diffusion and
	 social reproduction of sex radical ideas in rural America. I examine the
	 interpretative community that resulted from the commingling of <I>Lucifer</I>
	 readers' published letters, arguing that this interaction played a critical
	 role in shaping the individual and collective identity of rural sex radicals.
	 Ultimately, the power gained through print helped rural Americans place their
	 stamp on the sex radical movement even as they navigated late-nineteenth
	 century social and economic change.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper investigates the general reading
	 habits of rural Midwesterners at the turn of the twentieth century. Midwestern
	 farm families left evidence about their reading in letters, diaries, account
	 books, and other sources. My research suggests that country people read and
	 ecelectic mix of local newspapers, farm newspapers, magazines, and books. They
	 used reading to build and maintain their communities, to provide enjoyment for
	 themselves and their families, and to gain useful information for their lives.
	 It appears that rural Midwesterners read the same materials for the same

	 Midwestern farmwomen. It considers how increased spatial and social mobility
	 intertwined with women's uses of print in ways that affected their exercise of
	 cultural agency. This paper also shows how women made use of available print
	 opportunities locally and extended their reach to women in other places and

	 SIZE="+1"><FONT SIZE="-1">The family vacation became a standard feature of
	 American life after World War II, but African Americansfound their mobility
	 limited by Jim Crow laws in the South and outright discrimination elsewhere.
	 Many travelers turned to guides listing establishments that catered to a black
	 clientele, while others tested the color line in search of a "vacation without
	 humiliation." This paper challenges accepted notions of Cold War period travel
	 by examining the African-American experience, and argues that the image of
	 humiliation in front of one's children was important in gaining support for the
	 Civil Rights Act (1964). Ironically, the promise of equal treatment lured
	 African Americans to national motel and dining chains, resulting in declining
	 fortunes for black-owned resorts and eateries in rural

			 taking vacations expanded. Seeking to take advantage of this trend, tourist
			 agents and government officials marketed vacation in the rural Upper Great
			 Lakes to potential vacationers from cities, suburbs, and even small towns as
			 retreats, and to local residents as a means to revive their economies. Part of
			 the larger project, "Creating the Metropolis's Nature: Rural Tourism in
			 Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, 1910-1965," this paper examines the various
			 actors who re-imagined the region's landscape into a tourist attraction and the
			 local people who contested and accepted various policies regarding land use.
			 Combining recreation with engineering resulted in a "recreenered" landscape,
			 which suggests that conservation initiatives were intimately connected to

	 of wrenching questions about black people's claims to property. Years of
	 half-hidden struggle had settled into fragile, yet widely recognized customs
	 that gave slaves claims of access to land and a portion of their labor time.
	 Slaves, masters, and other whites had built a system of owning and trading
	 property that was anchored not in the law but in the yards and back roads of
	 everyday life. The ending of slavery threw these complex understandings and
	 practices into question. What was property? Who owned it? And what did
	 ownership mean? Wherever black people turned--working a crop, buying a cow,
	 renting a house, or even getting compensation for things soldiers had taken
	 from them--they confronted new ideas about property. Black life after slavery
	 involved intense, far-reaching negotiation with northern bureaucrats, white
	 landlords, and other black folk about the ownership and meaning of property.
