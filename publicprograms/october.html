Saturday, October 16, 9:30 am - 10:30 am</B><BR><BR>
Speaker: Alan M. Wald, University of Michigan<BR>
<blockquote>
In the three decades since the publication of his biography of James T. Farrell, Alan Wald has focused on the legacy of the American literary left. His path-breaking studies of the social and political history of left-wing writers in the period from the onset of the Depression to the height of the Cold War include The New York Intellectuals and Exiles from a Future Time. This talk will draw upon his new research on Chicago writers, which adds to our knowledge of such well-known novelists as Farrell, Willard Motley, and Nelson Algren, and draws attention to their less well-known contemporaries.<BR><BR>

American presidents and other politicians with fine wit and scathing comments about the state of

<B><font size="-1" color="#1E90FF">Outspoken, Indian Style:<BR>
The Untold Story of the American Indian Chicago Conference</font><font size="-1"><BR>
Wednesday, October 27, 2:00 pm</B><BR><BR>
Speaker: Daniel Cobb, Miami University, Ohio<BR>
<blockquote>
The former assistant director of the D'Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian History tells the story behind the story of the American Indian Chicago Conference of 1961. This week-long gathering at the University of Chicago attracted hundreds of Indian people from across the country. It is considered a critical turning point on the road to Red Power. The Conference's "Declaration of Indian Purpose" is an important early statement advocating tribal self-determination. Beneath the simple story of Indian people speaking out in the name of democracy rests a more complicated tale of suspicion, rumor, intrigue, and rebellion, reminding us of the complexities involved in being outspoken in Cold War America.<BR><BR>
Admission is free. No reservations are required.</blockquote>
