<div align="left">Mr. Lane:<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you would assemble information in regard to plans 
that may be in effect in various industrial concerns to stimulate and facilitate 
saving on the part of the employes.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should like to inaugurate some scheme that would induce 
our employes to save money: be thrifty in other words. The building and loan 
association plan is one means, but for some reason that doesn&#8217;t appeal to 
me. I have heard of savings clubs, but am not familiar with the pan of operation. 
I have a had a rather vague thought that if we could consolidate the monthly 
savings of our men we could in that manner invest the funds so that they would
earn more than the employes could secure on the small individual amounts which
they might have to deposit in the savings bank. To illustrate &#8211; the savings
bank allows 3%; by combining the funds we could buy bonds or other securities
that would pay 5%. I presume with all our employes the sum would run up to
a goodly amount, and the guarantee of the Company would have to be back of
the plan to make it thoroughly reliable. This would mean that a club would
have to be organized in each district or department. It might involve considerable
work, which means expense.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe we have talent enough to devise some original 
plan. With an outline of a plan in hand I should like to discuss it with bankers.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale of stock in the Company has some draw-back,
particularly with the working man, as the price of the stock is bound to
fluctuate. If it falls below the sum he pays for it, as a rule he is disgruntled,
even though the earning capacity of the stock is unimpaired.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe there is a field here to do good work in establishing 
more cordial relations with our employees. I have always felt that a workman 
with a bank balance is more conservative in his views and inclined to work 
more steadily to conserve his balance than the man with nothing at stake.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon my return I shall discuss this with you and the
gentlemen to whom a copy of this letter is being sent.<br>
