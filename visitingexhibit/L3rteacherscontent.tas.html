	 <H3><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</H3> 
	 <P>Chicago Teachers as Scholars (TAS) is a series of content-based
	 professional development seminars for Chicago Public School teachers. This
	 program is offered by the Newberry Library in partnership with the Chicago
	 Public Schools Teachers Academy for Professional Development and the Graduate
	 College of the University of Illinois at Chicago.</P> 
	 <P>The primary goal of TAS seminars is to improve the knowledge base of CPS
	 teachers in the subjects they teach. These seminars reconnect teachers with the
	 world of scholarship and keep them aware of recent scholarly developments in
	 their fields. In addition, the seminars introduce teachers to the Newberry
	 Library, a cultural institution that can sustain learning for them and their
	 students. Seminars allow teachers to study and discuss specific topics in the
	 humanities and sciences with their colleagues and an established
	 scholar/teacher. Each two-day seminar is designed to allow teachers time to use
	 one of the world&#146;s premier research facilities to enhance their classroom
	 teaching. Past participants of the program have expressed tremendous enthusiasm
	 for the intellectual rigor of the seminars and the stimulating discussions with
	 seminar leaders and their fellow teachers.</P> 
	 <P>Seminars begin at 9:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m. each day. Teachers are
	 required to attend both days of the seminars for which they are enrolled.
	 Seminars are conducted during the work week, with substitute coverage provided
	 by the CPS Teachers Academy for Professional Development.</P> 
	 <P>This collaboration between the Newberry Library, UIC, and Chicago Public
	 Schools enhances participants' classroom instruction by nourishing their
	 interest in their disciplines and their love of learning. These benefits do not
	 end when a seminar is over. After completing their seminars, TAS participants
	 are warmly welcomed into the Newberry's community of learners. In addition,
	 they receive special notices of ongoing opportunities to attend stimulating
	 public programs and workshops.</P> 
	 <P>We look forward to welcoming you to the Newberry Library to participate
	 in this exciting and challenging professional development program.</P> 
	 <H3><A NAME="eligibility"></A><A NAME="acknow"></A>Acknowledgments</H3> 
	 <P>We are grateful to the Polk Bros. Foundation, the Lloyd A. Fry
	 Foundation, The Albert Pick, Jr. Fund, Peoples Energy, The State Farm
	 Foundation, and McDougal Littell for generous funding that enables the Newberry
	 Library and the University of Illinois at Chicago to help enhance public
	 education in Chicago by offering high quality professional development for CPS
	 teachers. We are also grateful to the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship
	 Foundation for their support over the years.</P> 
	 <P>Finally, TAS would not be possible without the support of the Chicago
	 Public Schools administrators, principals, and teachers who have supported the
	 program over the years.</P> 
	 <H3>Participant Eligibility</H3> 
	 <P>Chicago Teachers as Scholars seminars are not open to the general
	 public. All Chicago Public School teachers may apply to participate in this
	 highly regarded professional development opportunity. A principal&#146;s
	 signature, approving participation in all of the seminars to which a teacher
	 has applied, is required on all submitted applications. Brochures for 2005-06
	 will be available soon. </P> 
	 <P>Teachers participating in Chicago Teachers as Scholars for the first
	 time may attend two seminars, while teachers who have previously attended TAS
	 seminars will be eligible to take one seminar per academic year. </P>

	 <P><B>Schedule</B><BR>Seminars begin promptly at 9:00 am and end at 3:00 pm
	 on both days. We will provide breakfast and lunch on both days. For the
	 seminars that meet at the Newberry, we will spend part of one day in Special
	 Collections. Please be aware that Library policy does not permit you to bring
	 coats or large bags, food or beverages, or writing utensils other than pencils
	 into Special Collections; these items are permitted in the seminar room.</P> 
	 <P> <B>Parking</B> </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><I>at the Newberry Library</I><BR>The Newberry Library is located at
		  60 West Walton Street. The parking garage address is 100 W. Chestnut, but the
		  entrance is on Clark Street, two blocks south of the library. The entrance is
		  often difficult to find, so be attentive. Additional parking is available at
		  671 N. Clark between Huron and Erie. Parking costs $6.00 per six hours, or
		  $8.00 for up to eight hours, with validation from the Newberry security guard.
		  </LI> 
		<LI><I>at UIC</I><BR>Attendees at the TAS seminars at the University of
		  Illinois at Chicago are directed to the Halsted/Taylor parking garage at 801 S.
		  Halsted. Most seminars are held in the Chicago Circle Center, a quick walk
		  directly across Halsted from the garage. When entering the garage, drivers will
		  pull a ticket from an automated gate. The ticket will be presented to the
		  attendant on duty upon exiting. Parking is $7.50 for the entire day. TAS
		  participants, however, are provided with a parking sticker to affix to their
		  ticket to release them from payment.</LI>
