		<B>Introduction</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did the Civil
		War end for white southerners? How did the former leaders of southern society
		define Reconstruction? They believed that they had exerted complete control
		over southern politics, economics, and culture before the war. After, they felt
		that their entire world had been turned upside down. W. E. B. Dubois has argued
		that southern planters felt that they were robbed of their identity, especially
		when lower-class whites and blacks attempted "to imitate the manners of a
		slave-nurtured gentility."<A HREF="#1">(1)</A> With the emancipation of their
		slaves, the presence of Northern troops on their soil and their economic future
		uncertain, many white southern aristocrats resolved to defy and rebel against
		the new order. The representatives of this segment of Southern society put
		forth their arguments in pamphlets as a means of an open forum and they were
		widely circulated. In addition to ex-politicians, judges, doctors, and
		ministers wrote these tracts. Many of the authors used religious references and
		enlightenment philosophy to support their arguments for self-government and
		theories of racial superiority. These pamphlets were powerful tools of
		persuasion. </FONT></P>

		<B>Racial Order and Political Power</B><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first part of my project, I wanted to
		understand what the white southern leadership believed at the onset of the
		Civil War about these subjects. Written in 1846, Matthew Estes's, <U>A Defence
		of Negro Slavery, as it exists in the United States</U> provided me with a good
		example. He defended the institution of slavery by arguing it was a universal
		economic necessity.<A HREF="#2">(2)</A> He also made a biological justification
		for the enslavement of blacks. <A HREF="#3">(3)</A> <B>
		<A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("estes.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		(See Document One)</A> </B>Physician John H. Van Evrie held similar views,
		which he discussed in his tract, <U>White Supremacy and Negro Subordination;
		or, Negroes a Subordinate Race, and (so-called) Slavery its Normal
		Condition</U>. (Although this was published in 1868, he wrote the main text
		prior to the start of the Civil War.) In his preface, he referred to the
		content as "a plain, simple, and truthful exposition of the natural order and
		social adaptation of the white and Negro races, as they existed in the Southern
		States, and indeed, in all the States, save one, when the Union was formed."
		Van Evrie argued that freedom would prove detrimental to the well-being of
		blacks. He claimed that in invading the South, the North had "torn four million
		. . . negroes from their normal condition, and [were] striving to 'reconstruct'
		American society on a Mongrel basis, as in Mexico, Central America, etc." <B>

		(See Images from Van Evrie's Book for Illustration)</A></B> (For a similar
		argument regarding the inferiority of Latin America see Kathy Pozniak's paper
		on "Fugitive Slaves in Mexico.") Van Evrie defiantly contended that
		"governments cannot exist an hour anywhere where these widely different races
		are forced into legal equality in approximate proportions."<A HREF="#4">(4)</A>

		<B>Contesting the Reconstruction Amendments</B><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southerners resisted the Reconstruction
		amendments. They still believed in their version of state's rights, however at
		odds with the federal government it might have been. Consequently, they made
		arguments that they believed might have a universal appeal; arguments based
		upon natural law and racism. In a tract entitled, <U>The Practical Philosopher
		and True Senator</U>, the anonymous author argued that voting was not a
		constitutional issue. Further, making it an issue by passing the 14th Amendment
		would put the nation in new peril because he believed that "inferior races who
		may be an element of our population" posed an even graver danger than former
		slaves.<A HREF="#5">(5)</A> His list included Chinese, Aztecs, natives of lower
		California and Mexico, Indians, and the "Mongrel races." This author suggested
		that if the constitution was to be amended it should be to substitute the words
		"white" and "duly naturalized" in the place of "free," since, according to him,
		this word no longer held any political meaning.<A HREF="#6">(6)</A> <B>

		<B>Radical Reconstruction</B><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Republican congressmen ushered in Radical
		Reconstruction in response to Southern defiance. Southerners still exploited
		many freedmen for their labor in an effort to keep things the way they were. In
		a report to the president on the condition of the South, General Carl Schurz
		made note of the quick imposition of laws, known as black codes, that
		restricted the labor opportunities and physical movement of blacks. Schurz
		believed that the planters had "absolutely no conception of what free labor
		is."<A HREF="#7">(7)</A> According to historian Charles L. Flynn, Jr.,
		"[slaveholders'] memories of the ideal black slave became indistinguishable
		from the ideal against which they judged free black workers."<A
		HREF="#8">(8)</A> Historian Theodore Branter Wilson has argued that the North
		interpreted the institution of the codes as a "categorical refusal to accept
		the verdict of the Civil War, a vindictive effort to thwart justice, and a
		conspiracy to retain the Negro in virtual slavery or peonage."<A
		HREF="#9">(9)</A> But many white Southerners viewed the codes as vital
		protection for their women and children and as the only practical way to induce
		the freedmen to support themselves. Radical Republicans demanded that the South
		give blacks higher status than that experienced by free blacks in the South
		prior to the war and, in fact, more liberty than that enjoyed by blacks in the
		North. Ultimately, as Wilson has contended, "these positions were poles apart
		and were equally unrealistic."<A HREF="#10">(10)</A> </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the South had long ago convinced
		itself of the inferiority of the "Negro race," it presumed that a separate
		system of regulations was necessary. The South resented the expectations of the
		North. An article in the <I>Natchez Democrat</I> on Christmas Day, 1865
		captured this vehemence: </P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="3"> "We do not know that obligation requires us to
		whine, like the whipped spaniel, about the footstool of power, we do not know
		that our obligations require us to get down upon our knees before the profane
		altars of an odious fanaticism, and cry 'pecca vimmus! Pecca vimmus! We have
		sinned! We have sinned!'<A HREF="#11">(11)</A> </FONT>
	 </BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written in 1871, <U>Concession, or, How
		the Lost Cause May Be Regained and the Independence of the South Secured</U>,
		is another excellent example of Southern resistance. The anonymous author
		presented his readers with a point by point plan for reestablishing southern
		independence and restoring their old way of life, their beliefs and their
		institutions. First, he reminded Southerners of the lives already sacrificed to
		maintain the Southern nation. Second, he argued the except for a common
		language, the North and South existed as completely separate nations with
		separate cultures, politics, and economies. Using a racially charged image, he
		contended that Radical Reconstruction had reduced the "ever proud, chivalric
		and glorious state of South Carolina . . . into a burlesque African republic."
		Ultimately, he called for a second rebellion. The mere threat of violence, he
		said, would be enough to force the Union to grant southerners' their single
		demand: independence.<A HREF="#12">(12)</A> <B><A

		<B>Conclusion</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abolishing slavery
		turned Southern aristocracy upside down. Feeling under attack, they interpreted
		these changes as both humiliating and debilitating. Southern planters found a
		medium, however, to voice their beliefs and their frustrations. Through
		pamphlets, Southern planters continued to defy the federal government after the
		Civil War. Their thoughts and feelings, however wrong and misdirected they may
		have been, reflect how precious and important their beliefs and way of life was
		to them. </P><HR>
