				  Chair</I></FONT></B></H3> This "Historian's Chair" was adapted from the
				National Writing Project&#146;s "Writer&#146;s Chair."&nbsp; As in the writing
				project, the Historians Chair places each participant in front of the group to
				present a coherent piece of work&#151;lesson plan, interpretation, or primary
				source analysis. Participants described this experience as both difficult but
				ultimately very rewarding.<BR> 
				<BLOCKQUOTE>Using <A

				  Mertz take his turn in the historian's chair. In the
				  <A
				  HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("mertza.mov", 250, 200, "toolbar,resizable,scrollbars", 20, 20)'>first
				  clip</A> (1.4 megs) he discusses the problems he had with his first project. In

				  <A
				  HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("mertzb.mov", 250, 200, "toolbar,resizable,scrollbars", 20, 20)'>second
				  clip</A> (2 megs), Mertz describes how he transitioned from his first to his
				  second project.<BR> </BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<BLOCKQUOTE>&#147;These sessions were so valuable because they
				  brought to the fore issues with which many of us struggle. The expectation of a
				  public presentation of our work kept everyone on point and forced us to
				  articulate a structured approach to a discrete historical question. As
				  teachers, it had been a while since many of us had to answer questions 'in the
				  hot seat,' making a defense of ourselves as history practitioners, accepting
				  the constructive criticisms of our peers. A good experience, no doubt. It also
				  forced us to ask again what constitutes good history, what is history&#146;s
				  value and how do we communicate that.&#148; <BR> <BR> &#147;While in the
				  historian&#146;s chair, we received valuable feedback about further questions
				  to ask and resources to use in our research. Furthermore, by explaining our
				  work to the class &#150; the majority of whom had not read our actual paper
				  &#150; we also learned whether our thesis was clear and coherent. Throughout
				  the process of the Historian&#146;s Chair, the class acquired a rich variety of
				  primary source material.&#148;<BR> </BLOCKQUOTE> <BR> </TD>
