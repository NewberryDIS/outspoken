            <td valign="top"><b>The Challenge</b><br>
        In the spring of 2001, Bob Orrill of the National Center for Education
   in the Disciplines brought together a group of historians and posed a
novel    challenge:&nbsp; create a model of professional development for
history  teachers  based on the highly successful model of the National Writing
Project.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Summer Institute</b><br>
        During the summer of 2002, a group of teachers from Illinois middle 
 schools,   high schools, and colleges came together for a month-long summer 
 institute   based on these ideas.&nbsp; As the institute syllabus makes plain,
 this was  a busy month.&nbsp; Participants met with scholars, discussed historical
  topics ranging over the entire chronology of the U.S. History Survey, conducted
   research in the Newberry Library, and wrote up research reports to communicate
   what they found. <br>
          <br>
          <i>Participants</i> included middle and high school teachers from 
 the greater Chicago area, college teachers, and research scholars.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Seminar sessions</i> focused on a common reading assignment
on  topics that included European-Native American interactions, the American 
Revolution, slavery, immigration, the New Deal, and several others. &nbsp;<br>

        <br>
        <i>The Historians Chair</i> is a concept adapted from the National
 Writing   Project&#8217;s writer&#8217;s chair.&nbsp; As in the writing project, the
Historians   Chair places each participant in front of the group to present
a coherent   piece of work&#8212;lesson plan, interpretation, or primary source
analysis.&nbsp;         <br>
        <br>
        <i>Research Projects.</i>&nbsp; Each participant carried out a research
   and writing project that explored an historical topic in some depth.&nbsp;
   The written portion is not a traditional "research paper," rather it is
 a  report on a participant's intellectual encounter with the past.<br>
