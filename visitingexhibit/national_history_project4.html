            In the spring of 2001, Bob Orrill of the National Center for
Education in the Disciplines brought together a group of historians and posed
a novel challenge:&nbsp; create a model of professional development for history
 teachers  based on the highly successful model of the National Writing Project.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The Summer Institute</b><br>
            During the summer of 2002, a group of teachers from Illinois
middle schools,   high schools, and colleges came together for a month-long
summer institute   based on these ideas.&nbsp; As the institute syllabus
makes plain,  this was  a busy month.&nbsp; Participants met with scholars,
discussed historical   topics ranging over the entire chronology of the U.S.
History Survey, conducted    research in the Newberry Library, and wrote
up research  reports to communicate what they found. <br>
              <br>
              <i>Participants</i> included middle and high school teachers 
from the greater Chicago area, college teachers, and research scholars.<br>
              <br>
              <i>Seminar sessions</i> focused on a common reading assignment 
on  topics that included European-Native American interactions, the American 
Revolution, slavery, immigration, the New Deal, and several others. &nbsp;<br>
       <br>
    <i>Workshops and Group Meetings</i> focused on developing and carrying 
out research projects.<br>
             <br>
             <i>The Historians Chair</i> is a concept adapted from the National 
Writing Project&#8217;s writer&#8217;s chair.&nbsp; As in the writing project, the Historians 
Chair places each participant in front of the group to present a coherent 
piece of work&#8212;lesson plan, interpretation, or primary source  analysis.&nbsp; 
        <br>
             <br>
             <i>Research Projects.</i>&nbsp; Each participant carried out 
a research and writing project that explored an historical topic in some depth.&nbsp;
The written portion is not a traditional "research paper," rather it is a
report on a participant's intellectual encounter with the past.<br>
