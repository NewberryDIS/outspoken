   <br>
   Mr. Hugh Percival Walden purchasing agent at Chicago and Pullman Car Works 
 for the last 16 years, has been appointed assistant to Vice-Pres. And Gen. 
 Mgr. L.S. Hungerford, the position vacated by Mr. Frank L. Wood when he became
 assistant general manager with headquarters at San Francisco. Mr. Walden
assumed his new position on May 7, and on the same date Mr. F.O. Reemer, assistant
director of purchases, assumed charge of the purchasing for the manufacturing
department.<br>
   <br>
   Mr. Walden&#8217;s entire business experience has been with the Pullman Company, 
 he having been employed as office boy on June 21, 1882, so he will have had
 41 years&#8217; continuous service this month. He was born Oct. 14, 1867, at Plumstead,
 Kent, England, and finished his schooling at St. Louis when his parents
removed  there. It was in the division superintendent&#8217;s office in St. Louis
that he  entered Pullman service and at that time Vice-Pres. Richmond Dean
was chief  clerk. In one year&#8217;s time Mr. Walden became a clerk, learned stenography,
 in May, 1885, was transferred to the district superintendent&#8217;s office, and
 in March, 1887, came to the Chicago offices following his chief, Mr. T.
H.  Wickes, when the latter was made general superintendent. From 1887 to
1905  Mr. Walden was secretary to Mr. Wickes, who by that time was vice-president
 and general manager. For the next two years he was assistant purchasing
agent,  and from March, 1907, to May 7 of this year purchasing agent with
headquarters  at the Pullman Car Works, handling the buying for the manufacturing
department.<br>
   <br>
   Mr. Reemer is a native Chicagoan and was educated in grammar school and
 business college. He began work in 1902 as office boy for the American Car
 &amp; Foundry Company and later became assistant to the supply agent in
Chicago.  In 1912 he became purchasing agent for the Haskell &amp; Barker
Car Company,  and in 1918-19 was its resident representative at Washington,
D.C. In 1922  when the Pullman Company absorbed the Haskell &amp; Barker
company Mr. Reemer  was made assistant director of purchases.<br>
