  <big><b>Memorandum for D. A. Crawford by F. L. Simmons, dated November
18, 1922</b></big><br>
 </div>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to the President&#8217;s Memorandum of October 25th, 
1922 addressed to Mr. Lane, relative to Savings Club.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in the East recently I made inquiries to ascertain 
what other industries are doing in the way of Savings Clubs.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found that in 1890 certain employees of the New York 
Central Railroad and of the American Express Company organized the &#8220;Railroad 
Co-operative Building and Loan Association&#8221;. This association has not been 
in successful operation under the supervision of the Banking Department of 
the state of New York for over 32 years and has resources amounting to $5,300,000 
and a surplus and undivided profits of $130,000.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is entirely separate and distinct from the New York 
Central Railroad; its only connection with the Railroad Company is that the 
majority of its officers and directors are officials or employees of the New
York Central Railroad, although the directorate includes some officials of
the American Express Company and of the American Locomotive Company.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present Chairman of the Board is Mr. J. F. Fairlamb, 
Auditor of Miscellaneous Accounts, New York Central Railroad.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While called a Building and Loan Association; its functions 
extend much beyond the scope of the ordinary building and loan association 
and it might more properly be described as a Savings Club.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any person may invest money in this association in any 
one or all of the three following ways:<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular Shares: Which requires a stated monthly payment 
of $1.00 a share. These shares are now earning interest at the rate of 6% 
per year. Dividends are paid semi annually.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Savings Shares: In which, on the same principle as a
savings bank, the member may deposit any sum of money at any time. These
share are now earning at the rate of 5% per year. Dividends are paid January
1st and July 1st on all amounts invested for more than three months before
these dates.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Income Shares: Which are issued at any time in amounts 
of $100 or multiples of that amount. The dividend to be paid is agreed upon 
at the time of investment and these shares earn from date of deposit.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should a member desire to draw on his deposit account 
he may do so at any time and this does not end his membership or prohibit 
his further participation.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All funds received on deposit are invested in first mortgages 
on improved New York City and suburban real estate within fifty miles of the
Grand Central Station. Monthly payments of principal and interest are required
on these mortgages, thus constantly increasing the margin of security.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Association owns its own building located at 437-439 
Lexington Avenue and valued at $238,000, and I am informed that the Association 
has been successful from the start.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Association makes the following statement:<br>
 
<blockquote>(line missing) &#8220;Started in 1890 by a group of railroad and express 
company employees for the purpose of enabling its members to conserve their 
savings and acquire homes, it has grown until now it has more than 11,000 
depositors. Through its assistance more than 2500 depositors have obtained 
homes. On our mortgage application for either buying or building a home, our
own depositors receive precedence and when mortgage money is in great demand
we accept applications only from our own members.&#8221;<br>
 </blockquote>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am verbally informed that any member who has deposits 
aggregating $50.00 or more to his credit may borrow $100.00 from the Association 
by obtaining in addition to his own signature on the note, the endorsement 
of any other member who has $50.00 or more on deposit.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have other data on this Association which will be furnished 
if desired.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some particulars the plan of the Railroad Cooperative 
Building and Loan Association seems to me to be more liberal and therefore 
more attractive to the investor than the plan suggested in Mr. Lane&#8217;s letter 
of November 8th, and since we are invited to criticize the plan which Mr. 
Lane has suggested, I will take the liberty to point out one of the two features, 
which possibly might be improved on.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article III &#8211; Deposits &#8211; Sec. 1. Requires a deposit of 
5% of the employee&#8217;s salary on each pay day by deduction from payroll.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest that the entire deduction be made from 
the pay day which falls on the 16th of the month, as rent, store bills, milk 
bills, etc., fall due on the first of the month and there is a greater demand 
on the employe&#8217;s purse in connection with the first of the month pay day than
the 16th of the month pay day.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there would be less accounting and less
expense if deductions were made only once instead of twice a month.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article III &#8211; Section 3. I do not like the proposition 
to impose fines upon employees and wish there could be some way to avoid this
as it would not serve to make the plan popular, but on the contrary would
prevent some employees from joining and the proposition of imposing fines
would be fully exploited by labor agitators.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article IV &#8211; Loans &#8211; Sec. 1. Is there is a real necessity 
for requiring endorsements on all loans in excess of $25.00, especially in 
those cases where the borrower has deposited more than the amount of the loan
requested.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article IV &#8211; Section 3. The proposal to charge interest 
on all loans at the rate of 1% per month, would, I believe arouse much adverse 
criticism and labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers would immediately claim 
that The Pullman Company is engaged in the loan shark business at the expense 
of its employees and Mr. Gompers would probably amplify his criticism to the
extent of saying that Pullman employees are so poorly paid that they are
forced to borrow money from the Company, which takes advantage of their necessities
by extorting loan shark rates of interest. Could we not make the loan rate
7% per annum.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article V &#8211; Withdrawals &#8211; Section 4; reads:<br>
 &#8220;A depositor who withdraws once cannot reenter and participate in the fund.&#8221;<br>
 Cannot this section be eliminated or so modified as to take care of contingencies 
which are certain to arise, and still not debar the employee from further 
participation.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are occasions where the long illness or death of 
a member of the family, or even the arrival of a new baby may create unusual 
expenses which the employee could not meet out of his current earnings and 
which might necessitate his withdrawing the amounts which he had deposited 
and which had accrued to his credit through his patient and earnest efforts 
and it would not seem that such unavoidable withdrawal should for ever after 
debar him from participation or membership in the Savings Club.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My understanding of the policy of the Management and
my own individual belief is that during this period of labor unrest and of
extreme activity on the part of various socialistic and communistic organizations, 
it behooves the Company to strengthen and popularize its own Plan of Employee 
Representation as the channel through which employees will have representation 
and a voice in matters affecting their welfare, and if we do not do this there
is great danger, proved by our own experience, that our employees will drift
into other and antagonistic organizations which are constantly soliciting 
their membership.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore earnestly recommend that these savings 
clubs be made in some way a part of the Plan of Employee Representation with 
local administration through our local joint committees, finally a Board of
Trustees on which the Bureau of Industrial Relations and Employee Representatives 
on the General Committees will be represented in the membership.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way a special incentive will be offered to join 
the Plan of Employee Representation.<br>
