 content="From the antislavery groups of the 1840s to the "poetry slam" movement of the present, Chicago has always been a vibrant locale for free speech activism.  Drawing on the combined collections of the Newberry Library and the Chicago Historical Society, Outspoken  will provide a rare opportunity to discover the history of political, cultural, and artistic dissent in Chicago and its hinterlands.

Parking is not available at the Library. Nearby public parking garages include the CPS garage at 100 W. Chestnut St. (the entrance is on Clark St. just north of Chestnut) and the Clark & Maple Garage on Clark Street between Oak & Elm (directly across from Dave & Busters). Metered street parking is heavily restricted during the morning and evening rush hours.
<p>
<font size="-1"><B><a name="pubtran">Public Transportation</a></B></font><BR>
By public transportation, the Clark Street No. 22 bus drops you off at the door of the Library coming north from the Loop, or on the west side of the Library if coming south; using the El or subway, take the Howard/Dan Ryan Red line to the Clark and Division stop. Walk 3 blocks south on Clark and the Library will be on your left.

Learn more. Both the Newberry Library and the Chicago Historical Society pride ourselves on the wide accessibility of our collections.  The majority of the materials in Outspoken are available to the public for those who wish to dig a little deeper.  We hope to see you soon in the Newberry's reading rooms and the Historical Society's research center.
