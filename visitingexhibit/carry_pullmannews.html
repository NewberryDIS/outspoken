    <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Every bit of energy that I possess will be put into
making the Pullman Company the most effective car building organization in
the world.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This excerpt from the remarks of President E. F. Carry 
symbolized the enthusiasm of the second annual banquet of the Industrial Relations
Committees of the Pullman Car Works and the Calumet Shops held at the Hotel
Sherman, Chicago, May 20. Some 300 committeemen and company officials attended,
listened to brief addresses and enjoyed a program of entertainment, the outstanding
feature of which was a selected representation from the Pullman Porters&#8217;
Chorus, under the leadership of the director, Maj. Smith.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. William McLaren, superintendent of the Pullman Car 
Works, was introduced as toastmaster by Mr. H. M. Downie, of the Employes&#8217; 
General Committee, and in introducing President Carry said, &#8220;he is a comparative 
stranger to most of the men of the men at Pullman, but he is with you.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Cooperation epitomizes the difference between success 
and failure,&#8221; said Mr. Carry. &#8220;Without cooperation-the backing up of you boys
in the shop-the best efforts of the officials will go for nothing. If we
haven&#8217;t been pulling in unison all the time we will in the future, be sure
of that.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It is the height of my ambition that the Pullman Company 
shall be known as the embodiment of efficiency and a happy family. If you 
hear any one deny that, refute it. Hit him on the nose, if necessary, but 
refute it. And if we do have a difference now and then, come in and talk it
over and hear our side of the matter. I came up from the ranks, just as you
fellows are doing, and I know your problems and I want to help solve them.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice-President J. B. Weaver though the Pullman Porters&#8217; 
Chorus typified the sentiment back of the Pullman Company. As one of the installers
of the Employes&#8217; Plan of Industrial Representation he paid tribute to the
committeemen, saying: &#8220;In the two years I was associated with you I never
saw you take an arbitrary position when all the facts were laid before you.
If we keep the outsiders out we can settle all our controversies among ourselves.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. William N. Oehm, manager of the works, also spoke 
as a man from the ranks.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Industrial Relations mean a whole lot,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
came from your ranks and I know that co-operation means everything. In these
days of close competition it is quite a problem, sometimes, as to how we
are coming out. But in figuring on contracts we must always consider the
men first; what the labor charge will be so that a living wage can be paid.
Then we take up the matter of materials and the other things it is necessary
to figure on.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. J. W. Martin, chairman of the general committee at 
the Pullman Car Works, made a strong plea for the Pullman commissary. <br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;The commissary belongs to you men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and its 
success rests with you. It will sell you anything from a needle to a steamship 
cheaper than you can buy it elsewhere. By handling things on a consignment 
basis we are going to show the Pullman Company how to keep down the overhead 
and still do business.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Louis Hofer, chairman of the Freight Shop Local Committee, 
told of changes made in hours and wages, the general result being he said, 
that &#8220;the Pullman Company is now one of the highest paying car building organizations 
in America.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;A year without a strike or a lockout and with numerous 
grievances handled amicably, shows that we have reached the broader grounds 
of mutual understanding, mutual confidence and mutual respect,&#8221; said Mr. F.
L. Simmons, supervisor of industrial relations. &#8220;We now have 203 local joint
committees operating in the United States and Canada. Approximately 2,500
suggestions, recommendations, petitions and grievances have been handled by
them without any break in our friendly relations.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Carry, while emphasizing the fact that he was 
making no promises, stated that two matters of great interest to the car workers
&#8211; industrial insurance and the establishment of a hospital- were being &#8220;actively
considered&#8221; by the officials, and expressed the hope that &#8220;both will come
out to our mutual satisfaction.&#8221;<br>
