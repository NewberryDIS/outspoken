		"What is an Assyrian?" While growing up on the North Side of Chicago, I
		typically received this as a response to my answer for "what nationality are
		you?" People often followed this up with "well, where is Assyria?" Nearly 100
		years after the first Assyrian immigrants made Chicago their home, most people
		still do not know "what is an Assyrian." In the first part of this project, I
		will give a brief history of the modern Assyrian. Next I will address the
		confusion between the terms Syrian, Assyrian, and Persian, as used in census
		reports, ship manifests and other types of literature that record ethnicity. I
		will show that in many cases the term "Syrian" really means "Assyrian" in much
		of the literature, even to the present day. Finally, I will discuss when and
		why Assyrians specifically came to Chicago during the early twentieth century.
		</FONT></P>
	 <P>
		<B>Who are the Assyrians?</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assyrians are
		ethnically, linguistically, culturally, and religiously distinct from their
		Arab, Kurdish, Turkish, Persian, and even Armenian neighbors. The modern
		Assyrian homeland is located in what is today southeastern Turkey, northern
		Iraq, and northwestern Iran (Persia). Modern Assyrians are Christians, and have
		been since the days of the Apostles. In the early days of the Church, The
		Assyrian missionaries of the Church of the East (Nestorian Church) spread
		Christianity throughout India, China, and as far east as Japan. Assyrians have
		faced numerous periods of persecution, especially as Islam spread throughout
		the Middle East. Once Islam was fully established as the religion of the
		majority, Assyrians became not only an ethnic minority, but also a religious
		one. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assyrians claim to be the descendants of the
		ancient Assyrian Empire, which collapsed in 604 B.C.E, and they have not had an
		independent homeland since that time. War, religious persecution and economics
		have forced many Assyrians to abandon their ancient homeland (I will discuss
		this in more detail in a later section). In 1929, William Ainger Wigram argued
		in his book, the <I>Assyrians and their Neighbors</I>, that "&#133;the present
		Assyrian, Chaldean, or Nestorian, [did] represent the ancient Assyrian stock,
		the subjects of Sargon and Sennacherib&#133;(Wigram, 1929)." Wigram came to
		this conclusion after studying the similarities in geography, linguistics,
		customs, and physical characteristics of the inhabitants (a common methodology
		in 1929) between the ancient Assyrians and their supposed modern descendants.
		Indeed the death of a civilization does not always mean the death of the
		people. The Mayan Civilization is a great example of this. The Mayan Empire
		collapsed around 900 C.E., but modern Mayan people still live in the same area,
		practice many of the same customs, and speak the same language as their
		ancestors did thousands of years ago. I cannot definitively prove or disprove
		that the Assyrians are the descendents of the ancient empire, but I think it is
		at least possible. The Assyrian people have always identified themselves as
		'Atooriya" which is translated as 'the descendents of Atoor" (Asher), but
		modern historians have used various terms to refer to Assyrians. This lack of
		consensus made it difficult for me to research my project, the subject of the
		next part of my paper. </P>
	 <P>
		<B>Persian, Syrian, Assyrian? What's in a Name?</B><BR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I set out to begin my research, I soon realized that
		I would not find a tremendous amount of information on "Assyrians," at least
		not modern Assyrians. The Newberry Library card catalog only indexed
		information regarding ancient Assyria. I then looked at published census
		reports and found that they did not mention Assyrians either. Still, I knew
		from my family's history that Assyrians had been in the United States since at
		least the early 1920s. I then read through some sociological sources from my
		period of study. Harvey W. Zorbaugh's book, <I>The Gold Coast and The Slum</I>,
		made reference to Assyrians as Persians, Christian Persian or Assyrian Persian.
		What I found frustrating was that Zorbough used the terms Assyrian and Persian
		interchangeably. I also found that I was not the first person to encounter this
		issue. In 1924, Syrian author Philio Hitti emphasized that he was writing about
		the "Syrians" of Syria, and not the Assyrians or Persian Syrians as they were
		sometimes commonly referred to in contemporary literature. However, based on
		what I found from ship manifests, census manuscripts and city directories, I
		think I can be reasonably sure that when the literature from the early
		twentieth century refers to Persian, they usually mean Assyrian. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching a few dead-ends with the catalog
		and literature, I decided to search for some common Assyrian names on ship
		manifests and passenger lists. This was made easier by virtue of the fact that
		there is a digital archive of these types of records at www.ellisisland.org. I
		found that if Assyrians migrated from Urmia, a province in the Persian Empire,
		then the manifests often listed their nationality as Persian. Using the
		manifest as a starting point, I wondered whether I could trace the whereabouts
		of a particular Assyrian immigrant. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with one case. I found a man named
		Abraham Sargis listed on the S.S. Friesland arriving in New York in June of
		1902. (On the site this name comes up as Abraham Sargas, which I believe is a
		misspelling after having looked at the original document.) Sargis is a very
		common Assyrian name, but more importantly it is also uniquely Assyrian. The
		manifest listed Sargis's nationality as 'Persian' and listed 'Ouroumia'(Urmia)
		as his "last place of residence." It also appeared from the document that New
		York was not Sargis's final destination. I then went to a 1910 city directory
		for Chicago to see if he had settled in this city. I did not find him, but I
		did find other Assyrians. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found, for example, Isaac Baaba living at 301
		W. Chicago Avenue.
		<A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("baaba.html", 640, 450, "toolbar,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		<B>(See Document One)</B></A> With his address in hand, I went to the
		1910 census manuscripts to try and locate Baaba. As luck would have it, I found
		him.
		<A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("census.html", 640, 480, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'><B>(See
		Document Two)</B></A> 'Place of birth' was listed as "Persian," but someone had
		also written the letters 'ass' over this word. My guess is that the
		census-taker meant 'Assyrian Persians.' Baaba was also the first Assyrian that
		the census taker encountered on this block. As I looked down the document, I
		saw several other "Assyrian" families listed as living in the same house as
		Baaba and others living on the same block. In addition, the census-taker had
		written Asia above their entries, presumably a reference to the category "other
		Asia" which they used in generating statistical reports. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding this information on Baaba, I then
		tried to document another person, Haidow Ablahat. Vasili Shoumanov mentions him
		in his recent book <I>Images of America: Assyrians in Chicago</I>.
		<A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("ablahat.html", 640, 350, "toolbar,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		<B>(See Document Three for City Directory Entry)</B></A> Shoumanov places
		Ablahat's immigration to Chicago in 1906 from Tkuma, Turkey, which was an
		Assyrian province like Urmia was in Persia. I was not able to find any records
		at Ellis Island for a Haidow Ablahat. I did, however, find records for a Kavmik
		Ablahat who emigrated in 1916 from Turkey. Based on his age, he was 71, I
		believe this might be the father of the man Shoumanov discusses, though I
		cannot prove this yet. In terms of my larger research project, what I found
		interesting about this case relates to the notion of confusion. Under the
		category of nationality, the ship manifest lists 'Syrian' with the word
		'Turkey' written over it in different handwriting. Similarly, in the section
		"race of person" the manifest lists 'Syrian' but then looks as if it was later
		corrected when someone added 'As' making it read "Assyrian," as in the case of
		the 1910 census entry for Isaac Baaba.
		<A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("http://www.ellisisland.org/", 640, 350, "toolbar,resizable", 20, 20)'><B>(See
		entry for Kavmih Ablahat at www.ellisisland.org)</B></A><B></B>
	 </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In searching on the web for other sources, I
		also found a reference on the Near East Foundations web site to the
		"Armenian\Syrian Genocide of 1915." The Near East Foundation is a charity that
		was founded as a result of the "Armenian\Syrian Genocide." However, I would
		argue that "Syrian" really means "Assyrian" since "Syrians" from Syria were not
		victims of the 1915 genocide. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have established that Assyrians were
		sometimes referred to as Persians, Syrians or Persian Syrians, I can now
		discuss my next question. </P>
	 <P>
		<B>The American Dream?</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When and why did
		the Assyrians come to the United States and Chicago? My initial hypothesis was
		that the first large groups came after 1915 as a result of the Armenian/Syrian
		(Assyrian) genocide by the Ottoman Turks and Kurds. Although this seems to be
		true, based on immigration statistics and on historical events that I will
		discuss in a moment, it does not explain when and why the first Assyrians came
		to the United States? As I began to read some of the literature and documents I
		began to see that the picture was much more complicated then I had originally
		thought. 1915, indeed seems to have been a turning point in the emigration
		pattern of the Assyrians, but something else was going on long before. To fully
		understand the story I need to give some background on what was going on in the
		region before 1915. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1830s, American missionaries were sent
		throughout the Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern world to convert as many
		people as possible to Evangelical Christianity. In <I>America and the
		Mediterranean World</I>, James Field discussed in great detail the missionary
		efforts of the American Protestant Evangelical movement in the Near East. Their
		early efforts to evangelize among the Greeks, Orthodox Syrians, Russians,
		Armenians and Moslems were not very successful. According to Field, however, in
		November of 1835, the American missionaries, Dr. Asahel Grant, Reverend Justin
		Perkins, and others reached "&#133;Urmia, birthplace of Zoroaster and principle
		settlement of the Nestorians country." In "Urmia the Americans were hospitably
		received; as they commenced their work on school cards, and on translation of
		testament and hymns, their hopes were high that this once-noted missionary
		church could be reawakened and its dry bones made to live." Field did not
		explain why the missionary work was successful among the Assyrians of Urmia,
		but they were. In contrast, he noted that the that missionary work among the
		"mountain Nestorians" was not as successful and that these efforts ended in
		1844, due to "Anglican interference." </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Assyrians received an education at
		the American schools set up by the missionaries in Urmia. By 1889, Assyrian
		graduates of these missionary schools were coming to the United States to
		attend colleges and universities, many of which were right here in Chicago.
		According to Shoumanov, Mr. Nuworhaj came to study Theology at McCormick
		Seminary in Chicago in 1889 and, in 1891, Isaac Adams came to attend "Mr.
		Moody's School (Moody Bible Institute), also in Chicago. These students laid
		the foundation for future Assyrian emigration to the United States. Later
		immigrants followed these same routes. Field summed it up well when he said
		"&#133;in retrospect it seems that the missionaries only imperfectly understood
		the nature of their sowing. Protestants the evangelists surely were, but they
		were also Americans, and at every station, in addition to the gospel message,
		the message of America was set forth." It is with these missionaries, I believe
		that the "American Dream" was planted in the minds of the Assyrians. Because of
		these missionaries, when times turned dark, and people were forced to flee
		their homes, many would come to call America home. Zorbaugh estimates the
		number of Assyrians living in Chicago before the war to be about two to three
		hundred; by the 1920s there were three to six thousand. Zorbaugh also noted
		that most of these early immigrants were young men. The events of 1915 would
		change that pattern. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events leading to and preceding 1915 are
		too detailed for this paper, but I will try to summarize what would become the
		worst tragedy for the Assyrian people. In 1933, Ronald Sempill Stafford wrote
		an extensive piece detailing the events of 1915 and the Great War in his book
		<I>The Tragedy of the Assyrians</I>. Much of what I know about the event's
		impact on the Assyrian community comes from reading his book and Wigram's work.
		According to these two authors, as the Turks were slaughtering the Armenians,
		Turkey asked the Assyrians to ally with them. The Assyrians rejected the
		Turkish offer and instead declared war on Turkey. A series of battles and
		massacres took place in which thousands of Assyrian were killed or forced to
		flee their homes. Thousands headed to Persia and Russia, but then the Russian
		Revolution took place and Assyrians were once again left defenseless against
		the Turks and Kurds. This is the time when American charities, like the Near
		East Relief, were organized to help Assyrian and Armenian refugees. When news
		of these events reached America, many Assyrians told their family members to
		join them in the United States. As word spread about America, thousands of
		Assyrian families immigrated to the United States. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time would allow me, further research in
		this area would include an analysis of census reports to try to see how many
		Assyrians actually came to the United States post 1915. Also I would like to
		research more about how Assyrians adapted to their new surroundings. What
		affect did the nativism of the 1920s have on the cultural and ethnic identity
		of the Assyrians? Were they able to maintain their cultural and ethnic
		identities in the wave of nativism? All questions for a future project. </P>
