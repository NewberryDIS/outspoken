				  Projects</I></FONT></B></H3> During the NHP summer institute, participants
				carried out research projects at the Newberry Library. Their topics varied, as
				did their goals in conducting research. Some hoped to develop materials for
				classroom use, and others were simply interested in a particular topic for
				personal reasons. &nbsp;Openly exploratory and tentative in their conclusions,
				these <A HREF="#essays">essays</A> are the tracings of teachers' engagement
				with the past and their desire for intellectual renewal.&nbsp; One of the most
				common threads in teachers' evaluations of the summer institute was that they
				learned just how difficult research can be.&nbsp; They experienced first
				hand&#151;often for the first time in years&#151;the frustration of spending
				day after day in the archive with nothing to show for their hard work.&nbsp;
				Then after modifying their question, they often struck a rich vein of
				documentation.&nbsp; <BR> <BR> Richard Mertz of Oak Park-River Forest High
				School wanted to do research on the post-World War I "red scare."&nbsp; He
				began with the question, "did employers use anti-radicalism as a way to
				undermine unions that were not particularly radical?" <BR> 
				<BLOCKQUOTE> "After spending two straight days, eight hours each
				  day, scanning microfilm at Harold Washington Library, I came to the conclusion
				  that the job of a historian is tedious&#133;.I got frustrated.&nbsp; Everywhere
				  I looked, I failed to find any interesting information.&nbsp; I realized that
				  the answer to my question was 'yes,' management did use the Red Scare to attack
				  all unions whether or not they were radical.&nbsp; There was no subtlety; I
				  could offer no real insight into the topic."</BLOCKQUOTE> Then Rich changed
				course and started looking through the papers of the Industrial Relations
				Department of the Pullman Company.&nbsp; Suddenly there was plenty of
				subtlety.&nbsp; Why was a notoriously anti-union corporation creating an
				Employee Representation Plan?&nbsp; Why did employees appear
				to&nbsp;participate avidly in Pullman's programs?&nbsp; The question of
				anti-unionism and anti-radicalism become more complicated and compelling in
				light of these documents. &nbsp;(See Rich Mertz take his turn in the
				historian's chair, talking about the

				<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">Quicktime</A>.)<BR> <BR> A different
				trajectory is visible in the report by Kathy Pozniak who teaches at Von Humbolt
				Middle School in Chicago.&nbsp; Kathy wanted to use the institute to find
				topics in American history that would appeal to the mainly Latino student body
				in her school.&nbsp; Initially she intended to do research on run-away slaves
				in the Caribbean and Mexico, but after some initial forays she focused on the
				latter.&nbsp; As she discovered, parsing out the history of Texas itself was a
				major part of the project, however, in that process she was able to find
				numerous references to south-bound run-aways.&nbsp; Kathy concluded that "the
				process of writing up the research helped me realize that a small event in
				history does not mean an unimportant event."&nbsp; The African Americans who
				escaped enslavement by crossing the Mexican border were part of a broader
				history of US-Mexico relations, Manifest Destiny, and Mexican
				Independence.&nbsp; In her evaluation of the institute, Kathy wrote that "It
				had been about 20 years (gasp) since I did this depth of research on a
				historical topic.&nbsp; It reminded me how frustrating it could be, but also
				how interesting and exiting."<BR> <BR> The <A NAME="essays">essays</A>
				published on this site are artifacts of this process.&nbsp;
