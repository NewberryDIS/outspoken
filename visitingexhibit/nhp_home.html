				of 2001, the National Center for Education in the Disciplines brought together
				a group of historians and posed a novel challenge:&nbsp; create a model of
				professional development for history teachers based on the highly successful
				model of the National Writing Project. &nbsp;Following discussions with
				teachers, scholars, and history educators we settled on the concept that "doing
				history" involves not only content knowledge and memorization, but also
				learning how to ask the right questions, working with historical sources in
				archives and libraries, and sharing interpretations with fellow researchers,
				students, and others.<BR> <BR> <B>The Summer Institute</B><BR> During the
				summer of 2002, teachers and scholars in Chicago and Bloomington, Illinois, and
				Cleveland, Ohio, participated in summer institutes based on the National
				History Project principles.&nbsp; This Web site provides details about the
				Newberry Library institute, titled "Doing History in the Classroom:
				&nbsp;Rethinking the Introductory U.S. History Course." &nbsp;At our month-long
				institute participants met with scholars, discussed historical topics ranging
				over the entire chronology of the U.S. History Survey, conducted research in
				the Newberry Library, and wrote up research reports to communicate what they
				found. <BR> <BR> <I><A
				HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("nhp_participants.html", 640, 450, "toolbar,resizable,scrollbars", 20, 20)'>Participants</A></I>
				included middle and high school teachers from the greater Chicago area, college
				teachers, and research scholars.<BR> <BR> <A
				HREF="summerinstitute.html"><I>Seminar sessions</I></A> focused on a common
				reading assignment on topics that included European-Native American
				interactions, the American Revolution, slavery, immigration, the New Deal, and
				several others. &nbsp;<BR> <BR> <A HREF="summerinstitute.html"><I>Workshops and
				Group Meetings</I></A> focused on developing and carrying out research
				projects.<BR> <BR> <I><A HREF="historianschair.html">The Historian's
				Chair</A></I> is a concept adapted from the National Writing Project&#146;s
				writer&#146;s chair.&nbsp; As in the writing project, the Historians Chair
				places each participant in front of the group to present a coherent piece of
				work&#151;lesson plan, interpretation, or primary source analysis.&nbsp; <BR>
				<BR> <I><A HREF="researchprojects.html">Research Projects</A>.</I>&nbsp; Each
				participant carried out a research and writing project that explored an
				historical topic in some depth.&nbsp; The written portion is not a traditional
				"research paper," rather it is a report on a participant's intellectual
				encounter with the past.<BR> </TD>
