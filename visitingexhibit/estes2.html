[Page 226]  What has been the result of the abolition excitement upon the white population at the South?  I shall here be compelled to differ with my friends, I am fully satisfied that discussion has tended to strength the institution rather than otherwise.  When this discussion first commenced years ago, scarcely a man could be found in the Union who had the boldness to advocate Slavery as an abstract right.  Slavery was defended simply upon the ground of expediency, and hence all parties agreed, that it should be abolished just as soon as it could be effected.  So strong in fact, was the anti-slavery feeling at the South, that the State of Virginia, the largest Slave State in the Union came within a few votes of abolishing it.  I well recollect the sensation created by the publication of Professor Dew's work on Slavery, some fifteen [page 227] years since.  The abolition excitement was just then beginning at the North, and the South had no arguments to meet them; they had never pretended to defend Slavery in the abstract, hence they were taken all aback by the arguments of their opponents.  But Professor Dew's work opened the eyes of the South upon the subject; he advocated Slavery upon the ground of abstract right, and thus we were prepared with arguments to meet our opponents.<BR>
<p>
Since that time we have had various able publications on the subject; many sermons and lecturers, which have greatly enlightened the public mind on this institution.  But they have not, as I humbly conceive, presented the full strength of the argument in favor of Slavery, and the present work is a feeble attempt to supply the deficiency.
As the public mind has been enlightened, men have become more convinced of the indispensable necessity of Slavery in the present state of the world.  <I>As has been before remarked practical Slavery does, and must necessarily exist in all countries.  The laws may abolish the institution, but the necessities of existence will force Slavery upon all the poorest classes of society.</I>  This is the fact in England, and in nearly all other countries where theoretical Slavery does not exist. <BR><P>[page 228]  The state of the world must greatly change before Slavery can in reality be abolished; the means of living must be within the reach of all classes, without the necessity of any considerable degree of hard drudgery.  In a word, agriculture, the mechanic arts, and machinery of all kinds must so improve, that men, without any considerable toil, can supply all things needful for their comfort and happiness.  So long as there is rough work to do, there must be rough hands to do it, and these rough hands will never be applied to such purposes, unless they are driven to it by necessity or by authority.
