	 Communications Industry During the Wilson Administration,
	 1917-1921"<BR></B>Jonathan Reed Winkler, Yale University</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT
	 SIZE="-1">A little known story in the history of communications technology,
	 business and U.S. foreign policy occurred in the waning months of the First
	 World War. The Department of State, having become sufficiently concerned about
	 the political and economic implications of inadequate submarine telegraph cable
	 connections with Japan, China and the rest of Asia, took the lead in pushing
	 the development of a submarine telegraph cable industry in the United States
	 largely from scratch. The overall intention was to create a complete industry,
	 capable of researching, developing, manufacturing and laying cables, that would
	 allow the United States to lay its own global network without having to resort
	 to the commercially or technologically superior British cable industry. Though
	 ultimately unsuccessful, the State Department's efforts to launch a cable
	 industry epitomized the changing worldview of certain U.S. officials about the
	 place of the nation in the world after World War I as well as growing concerns
	 about the security implications of dependency upon foreign powers for access to
	 important technological innovations and raw materials. Also significant is that
	 while the cable industry intervention failed, the parallel effort by the United
	 States Navy into the nascent radio industry yielded the successful Radio
	 Corporation of America. Drawing upon archival source from diplomatic, military
	 and business records, this work is an outgrowth of a larger dissertation on
	 U.S. foreign relations and international communications technology in the
	 Wilson Administration. </FONT></P>

	 "Modernity, Gender, and Technology During the Popular Unity Government in
	 Chile"</B><BR>Margaret Power, Illinois Institute of Technology</FONT><BR><FONT
	 SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>The Popular Unity (UP) government of
	 Salvador Allende (1970 to 1973) promised to modernize the nation. As Marxists
	 and as nationalists, many UP leaders equated modernity with industrial
	 development, the forging of a more equitable society, and the nationalization
	 of domestic and foreign, principally U.S., financial and industrial holdings.
	 This paper will explore the UP's conceptualization of modernity and gender, the
	 policies it employed to achieve its goals, how it understood and used
	 technology and science to advance its project, and the measures it adopted in
	 the face of attempts to undermine it.</FONT></P>

	 Your Plant a Target?' Cold War Civil Defense and the Rise of the High-Tech
	 Suburb"</B><BR>Margaret Pugh O'Mara, Stanford University<BR><BR>In the early
	 years of the Cold War, the Truman Administration took a series of
	 administrative steps to establish a civil defense policy of "industrial
	 dispersion" to encourage manufacturers to move out of potentially vulnerable
	 central cities. A quiet effort that operated largely below the political radar
	 screen, the dispersion campaign focused its attention on defense contractors
	 --particularly small scientific firms with a heavy dependence on government
	 business. This paper explores how these policies worked in concert with other
	 federal tax and infrastructure measures to pull high-tech industry out to the
	 suburbs, having an enduring effect on the economic landscape of late twentieth
	 century America.</FONT></P>

	 </B><I>(formerly Weapons, War, adn the Early Modern Japanese State,
	 1440-166-)</I><BR>William D. Johnston, Wesleyan University</FONT><BR><BR><FONT
	 SIZE="-1">A monopoloy on the use of organized violence is a necessary condition
	 for the establishment of both the early modern and the modern state. Historians
	 of Europe have shown clearly how the rise of firearms and other technological
	 changes helped determine battlefield outcomes, and consequently the rise of
	 early modern political structures. Historians of Japan have often pointed out
	 that firearms transformed the battlefield during the sixteenth century. Yet, it
	 has not yet become conventional wisdom that trained companies of musketeers
	 brought about both the demise of the traditional samurai and the rise of the
	 early modern state by the year 1600. This paper demonstrates how this happened,
	 and how the appearance of the early modern state in late-sixteenth-century
	 Japan resulted from its integration in contemporary economic, technological,
	 and political networks with global reach. The wider conclusions contribute to
	 the reinterpretation of Japan's "isolation" from the seventeenth century, which
	 was less important for cutting off the country from global networks as for
	 marking its position in them. Consequestion, the "opening" of Japan in the
	 nineteenth century did not change Japan's position in international relations
	 so much as it re-integrated the country in global networks of political
	 relations, economy, and technology.</FONT></P>

	 the Railroad, and Cultural Change, 1870-1900"</B><BR>Amy G. Richter, Clark
	 University</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper is
	 part of a larger study tracing the experiences and depictions of women railroad
	 passengers during the second half of the nineteenth century. It investigates
	 the "New Women" and "American Girls" of fiction, journalism and advertising
	 copy deemed fit for the rails. Understanding the context in which brave and
	 capable white women were celebrated as public actors reveals how the social and
	 cultural changes posed by the railroad reshaped gender identities - confounding
	 the Victorian ideal of separate spheres while reconciling the demands and pace
	 of the railroad with familiar qualities of Victorian womanhood.</FONT></P>

	 Power and Nature in the 20th Century Southwest" </B><I>(formerly "Mapping
	 Power: Urban Space and 'Second Nature' in the American
	 Southwest")</I><BR>Andrew Needham, University of Michigan</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1930, residents of central Arizona's Salt River
	 Valley received their electric power from a number of small power plants all
	 located within a 50-mile radius of downtown Phoenix. In 1968, residents of the
	 Valley of the Sun relied on a sprawling network of hydroelectric dams and coal
	 and natural gas-fired power plants centered on northern Arizona's Colorado
	 Plateau, plants that also supplied consumers in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and
	 Albuquerque. This paper examines this transition from local to regional power
	 production in order to investigate the new relationships between nature,
	 technology, and capital forged by urban growth and rural industrialization in
	 the postwar Southwest.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR><B>April 23, 2004 </B>-<B>
	 "Culture and the Transfer of Technology: Sewing Machines, Glass Bottles, and

	 Transfer of Technology: A Case Study from Late Nineteenth-Century Mexico")</I>
	 </FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Ted Beatty, University of Notre Dame</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Between 1880 and 1910 Mexico
	 underwent its first significant era of industrialization and economic growth,
	 based in large part on the introduction of new technologies from abroad.
	 Historians have long recognized the tremendous flow into Mexico during this
	 period of machinery, tools, and industrial methods, as well as the considerable
	 dependence of Mexican industry on foreign technicians. Yet the link betwen
	 these two developments remains largely unexplored.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper considers technology transfer in late
	 nineteenth century Mexico. It is based on three cases: sewing machines, glass
	 bottles, and cyanide (a process used in the mining industry). In each cae, no
	 one possessed perfect information. Innovators typically knew far more about the
	 original design and purpose of a new technology than they did about its
	 deployment in the particular social, economic, and political environment of
	 lae-nineteenth-century Mexico. Consumers assumed the innovation process would
	 be frictionless; in fact, it often involved a reciprocal adjustment betwen the
	 technical object, its user, and the local setting.</FONT></P>
