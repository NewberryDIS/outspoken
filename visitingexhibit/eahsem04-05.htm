  in Common Sense: the Pennsylvania Context of Thomas Paine's Egalitarian
  Emotional Rhetoric</B><BR>Nicole Eustace, New York University</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In January of 1776, a year after arriving in British
  America, Thomas Paine penned the pamphlet <I>Common Sense </I>and urged his
  readers to "examine the passions and feelings of mankind," confident that any
  such scrutiny would inevitably lead to support for American independence. By
  invoking the "passions and feelings" of <I>all </I>mankind, Paine sought to
  promote a universal concept of human emotion, to collapse eighteenth-century
  distinctions between the supposedly refined feelings of genteel sensibility and
  the purportedly irrational passions of common servility. While Paine, a recent
  arrival in Pennsylvania in 1776, has often been regarded primarily as a
  trans-Atlantic figure - an Englishman who stopped off for a time in America on
  his way to revolutionary France - he should also be recognized as a Quaker-born
  writer who composed the piece <I>Common Sense </I>in Philadelphia at the close
  of a decades-long Pennsylvania pamphlet war that had long debated public policy
  using emotional rhetoric. This paper casts <I>Common Sense</I> as the
  culminating production of eighteenth-century colonial Pennsylvania
  debates.<BR></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>November 18, 2004</B>&#151;<B>"Cheats

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1741 the New York Supreme Court, suspecting a
  conspiracy, ordered the execution of thirty slaves and four whites and the
  expulsion from New York of more than seventy other people. In all, close to two
  hundred people were arrested and interrogated. Two individuals were the driving
  force behind these trials: Supreme Court Justice Daniel Horsmanden and his
  chief witness, Mary Burton, a sixteen-year-old indentured servant. Through the
  figures of Horsmanden and Burton, I examine the relationship between financial
  credit and personal credibility, in a city where the economy was beginning to
  incorporate the international into the local. Both Horsmanden and Burton,
  although separated by status and sex, were typical eighteenth-century New
  Yorkers. Like the confidence tricksters and counterfeiters who found their way
  to the city, Horsmanden and Burton took advantage of New York's role as an
  <I>entrepot </I>for people and goods in order to achieve financial and personal
  success.<BR> </FONT> <BR> <FONT SIZE="-1"><B>December 16, 2004</B>&#151;<B>A
  "Reciprocally Beneficial" Trade: Economic Exchange on the Lower Missouri River
  Valley Frontier<BR></B>Rebekah M. Mergenthal, University of Chicago</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the 1820s and 1830s, white settlers in the lower
  Missouri Valley clamored for the removal of Indians from their vicinity. At the
  same time, however, this vision of separation coexisted with trade that led to
  frequent interactions between Natives and whites, since in a cash-poor frontier
  economy, white settlers found that selling goods and alcohol to the nearby
  Native Americans provided an important source of hard currency, as well as a
  fairly stable market. Natives' own actions played a crucial role in shaping the
  world of the river valley as well, as they appropriated the language of rights
  and decided the form of their annuity payments. This paper explores this
  economic accommodation in order to understand the kind of removal sought and
  the range of local responses to it, both from whites and Natives. By
  juxtaposing these conflicting views, this paper will illuminate the tensions
  and tolerance between disparate groups in the area and explore the kinds of
  cultural frontiers facilitated by the movement of goods and people in the lower
  Missouri valley in the early nineteenth century.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT>

  Cultural Work of Salem Witchcraft </B><I></I><B><BR></B>Gretchen A. Adams,
  Texas Tech University</FONT><BR> <BR> <FONT SIZE="-1">While the studies of
  "positive" national symbols abound in the burgeoning field of cultural memory,
  little or no attention has been paid to the cultural work performed by
  "negative" national symbols, Salem's witch hunt has, for over 300 years,
  functioned as a domestic cautionary tale. This paper argues that while positive
  icons are in times of crisis to suggest appropriate courses of action that
  define the normative self and community, negative symbols such as Salem are
  used to police the cultural boundaries of that same community by warning
  against the consequences of ill-advised actions.</FONT><FONT

  </B><I>(Formerly titled: Pulpits, Piety and Power: Anglican Architecture and
  Cultural Formation in Colonial South Carolina)</I><BR>Louis P. Nelson,
  University of Virginia</FONT></FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT SIZE="-1">Seventeenth and eighteenth-century
  Anglicans had a problem. They loved building great churches. But together with
  other Protestants, Anglicans held a theological commitment to the omnipresence
  of God, a commitment that undermined the possibility that God was somehow more
  present in the space of the church. To resolve this problem, Anglicans enlisted
  the senses to communicate the present of God and defend the sanctity of the
  church (small "c" as in the building) without having to constrain the divine.
  Depending on a case study of early colonial South Carolina, this paper examines
  the ways Anglicans used early modern understandings of sight, sound, and smell
  to imbue their churches with sanctity. It raises questions about the cultural
  work of signs and symbols, the power of the written word, and the complexity of
  metaphor in the context of a world deeply invested in the reality of the
  supernatural to explore the construction of sacred space.</FONT></FONT></P>

  Trans-Atlantic Family Correspondence in the Age of Revolution</B><BR>Sarah
  Pearsall, Andrews University, Scotland</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Would the husband return to his wife after the war ended?
  This question vexed fictional and historical couples during the American
  Revolutionary War. The War divided not only countries but also married couples,
  who, even in peace, sometimes found themselves separated by the Atlantic. The
  microhistory of Charles and Catherine Dudley, like many similar stories, raises
  significant issues about marriage and gender in a state of political, economic,
  and military flux. This paper argues that emphasis on ties of marriage kept
  connections up across war and the Atlantic, even as it also signaled
  disagreement and the complex working out of domestic authority. The
  destructiveness of war forced couples into liminal settings, as households were
  broken apart. These settings propelled a re-thinking of the strength of
  sentimental ties, in a world in which such sentiment often received little
  reward. Letters were a critical means for many to keep together and also to
  re-order their worlds. This paper, like the larger project from which it comes,
  interrogates letters from families divided by the Atlantic in a revolutionary
  age in order both to argue for the strength of transatlantic epistolary
  sensibility, especially in the hands of women, and to delineate its
  limits.</FONT></P>

  Constitution promises to "ensure domestic tranquility," and historians have
  long understood that one of the Framers' goals was to fund a national army
  mighty enough to crush plebeian insurrection. There was also another link
  between insurgency and the Constitution. In the immediate aftermath of the
  Revolutionary War, rebellion - and more commonly, the threat of rebellion -
  repeatedly forced the thirteen state legislatures to adopt tax and relief.
  These relief laws appalled nearly all prominent Americans (not to mention most
  modern historians), and finding ways to prevent their passage was high on the
  agenda when the Constitutional Convention delegates assembled in May 1787. By
  that time, men who had once ascribed relief legislation to the fear of
  rebellion now blamed it on what Elbridge Gerry and Alexander Hamilton both
  called an "excess of democracy." Like most modern historians (especially Gordon
  S. Wood), the convention delegates detached the issue of rebellion from the
  problem of legislative relief in a way they had not done as state legislators.
  Putting the two issues back together alerts us to the need for a closer look at
  the ways in which desperate debtors and taxpayers manipulated their social
  betters' fear of agrarian insurgency.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
