  Efficiency in Britain, 1890s-1939<BR></B>Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska, University
  of Illinois at Chicago</FONT> </P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The specter of physical deterioration and high rejection
  rates among military recruits in Britain inaugurated a national efficiency
  campaign which coupled imperialism with social reform and aimed to raise the
  standard of health and fitness of the worker and the soldier. The paper
  highlights the relationship between government initiatives and the patriotic
  physical culture movement which advocated modern techniques to enable men to
  develop their bodies before the First World War. Physical culture gained in
  popularity in the 1920s and faced with a growing threat from Nazi Germany, the
  government launched a national fitness campaign to build an "A1" nation in the
  late 1930s.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT> <B><FONT SIZE="-1">October

  Early Republic</B><BR>Sean Patrick Adams, University of Central
  Florida</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the United States during the early republic, a series
  of wintertime firewood shortages in large cities triggered popular protests
  that hastened a quest for new heating technologies. In response to these
  protests, upper-class urbanites created philanthropic organizations to meet the
  heating needs of the working poor. These organizations propagated the belief
  that the lower orders should switch from wood to coal. In so doing, they
  blurred the line between philanthropic outreach and the encouragement of new
  forms of fuel consumption--and, in the process, underscored the extent to which
  the adoption of new heating technologies could be shaped by political
  considerations largely unrelated to matters of economic
  efficiency.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR></FONT>

  Krysko, Dowling College</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1939, the U.S.
  shortwave station W6XBE began trans-Pacific broadcasts to an enthusiastic
  American audience in East Asia. However, controversy soon enveloped the
  station. Japan jammed American news broadcasts for their presumed bias against
  Japan's expansionist objectives in East Asia. This paper explores audience and
  diplomatic responses to W6XBE's travails. It examines how culturally based
  notions of "objective" news informed American reactions to the station's
  troubles. Capturing shortwave broadcasting's potential as a divisive force in
  international relations, W6XBE's difficulties became intertwined with the
  broader deterioration of Japanese-American relations that resulted in the
  Pacific War of 1941-1945.</FONT></P>

  Nation: Techno-Nationalism in Electric Power in Sweden, 1897-1923</B><BR>Mats
  Fridlund, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, and Northwestern
  University</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper describes the founding by the Swedish
  government of an electric power utility - the <I>Royal Board of Waterfalls
  </I>- and the construction of this utility's first electric power plants
  between 1906 and 1926. It contends that the exploitation of Swedish hydro power
  cannot be fully understood without taking into account the ideology of
  nationalism. In Sweden, electric power technology strengthened the political
  autonomy of the Swedish nation-state and helped create a new, and emphatically
  modern, Swedish national identity.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT><BR><FONT

  Media: Newspaper Ownership of Radio Stations in 1920s America</B><BR>Michael
  Stamm, University of Chicago</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Newspapers formed the most important group of radio
  station owners in the first decade of commercial radio broadcasting in the
  United States. Newspapers became involved in radio for several related reasons:
  scientific curiosity and experimentation on the part of publishers, strategic
  business calculations that radio might be a future competitor or adjunct to the
  press, and the desire to extend the civic functions and political presence of
  the newspaper using the new technology of radio. This paper explores the ways
  that newspapers - large and small - used radio to enhance their social,
  commercial, and political positions, in the process laying the foundation of
  what would later become the "mass media" or "media monopoly." Far from being
  supplanted by the new medium of radio, newspapers profoundly shaped the
  direction of American broadcasting.</FONT></P>

  <B>Telephomania: The Contested Origins of the Urban Telephone Exchange in the
  United States, 1879-1894 </B><I>(previously titled: Western Union, the Railway
  Mail Service, and the Origins of the American Telephone
  Industry)</I></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Richard R. John, University of Illinois
  at Chicago</FONT></P> 
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Recent scholarship on the early history of telephony in
  the United States focuses primarily on the expansion of telephony into rural
  districts in the period after the expiration of Alexander Graham Bell's
  fundamental telephone patents in 1894. My paper redirects our understanding of
  early American telephony by focusing on the rise in the 1880s of the large
  urban exchange. At the center of my story is Charles N. Fay, the acerbic
  general manager of the Chicago Telephone Company. Fay's contempt for telephone
  users was legendary: at one point, he publicly declared that they suffered from
  a "telephomania" that predisposed them to be hostile toward his company. My
  paper reconstructs Fay's struggles with his customers, his competitors, and the
  Chicago City Council. In so doing, it demonstrates how the forgotten history of
  these early struggles shaped the subsequent rise of the telephone network in
  the United States.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>April 22, 2005 - Conventions of
  Simultaneity: Government-Sponsored Timepieces in the United States,
  1870-1920<BR></B><FONT SIZE="-1">Alexis McCrossen, Southern Methodist
  University<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">This paper argues that the standardization of
  time set off an extensive program of public timepiece installation in the
  United States that fed what historian of science Peter Galison has identified
  as "conventions of simultaneity." In addition to office buildings, stores, and
  churches, lavish, large, expensive clocks often distinguished the City Halls,
  County Court Houses, and federal buildings going up across the nation during
  the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. The account books of the E. Howard Clock
  and the Seth Thomas Clock Companies, who together held a duopoly over the
  production of public timepieces between 1870 and 1920, provide much of the data
  for the paper.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
