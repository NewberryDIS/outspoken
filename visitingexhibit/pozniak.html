	 <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. history is
		filled with stories of the Underground Railroad. Mention fugitive slaves and
		inevitably attention is drawn north - first to the northern states, and later,
		after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, further north yet to
		Canada. Yet thousands of slaves gained their freedom through a different route
		- into Mexico. In this paper, I hope to show that while slave escapes into
		Mexico may be only a small chapter in history, it adds another integral layer
		towards understanding the political, social and economic developments of the
		antebellum era.</FONT></P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1821, the Spanish government granted
		land to Moses Austin, an American, in Mexico. Unable to entice internal
		migration to this vast and unoccupied territory, the Spanish decided to take
		the unusual step of encouraging foreign immigration to establish a base of
		small rural landholders. <A HREF="#1">(1)</A> A few months after this grant,
		Mexico won its independence from Spain. And, although Moses Austin died before
		leading settlers into Mexico, this unique scheme for settlement was not
		abandoned. Shortly after its establishment, Mexico allowed Stephen Austin and
		other U.S. citizens to occupy land within the Mexican state of Texas. These
		settlers brought their slaves with them. By 1825, one out of five residents in
		Texas was a slave. <A HREF="#2">(2)</A></P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on September 15, 1829, Mexican
		President Vicente Guererro abolished slavery.<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> Ten years
		later, U.S. Senator John Niles characterized this action as a "hazardous
		experiment." In his book, the <U>History of South America and Mexico</U>, Niles
		argued that Spanish methods of colonization, in particular the practice of
		intermarriage with indigenous peoples, had caused a deterioration in their
		innate intelligence level and, consequently, their ability to practice
		democracy. Niles contended that any further heterogeneity would only guarantee
		the fall of the Mexican republic.<A HREF="#4">(4)</A></P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two and a half months after Mexico
		abolished slavery and for reasons unrelated to Niles's opinion, Texas Governor
		J.M. Viesca secured an exemption for his state. The land fees generated an
		important source of income for the local government.<A HREF="#5">(5)</A>
		Nonetheless, Mexican officials were uneasy about the numbers of new Americans
		settling within Mexico and they attempted to curb the number of newcomers,
		including slaves, in another way. In 1830, Mexico decreed that foreigners could
		not cross the border without obtaining a passport issued by Mexican agents.<A
		HREF="#6">(6)</A> The Mexican government, however, was generally ineffectual in
		enforcing this law and it was largely ignored.</P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While slaveholders looked to Mexico for
		land, so too did abolitionists. In 1832, Benjamin Lundy attempted to acquire
		land in Texas for the purpose of establishing a colony for ex-slaves. Lundy
		favored colonization because he believed it was a way to end slavery; slaves
		would be freed only if their owners could be guaranteed that they would then
		leave the United States.<A HREF="#7">(7)</A> Furthermore Lundy realized freed
		slaves in the U.S. would still be subjected to racism and discrimination. In
		Lundy's opinion, they would have a better chance someplace where they would
		enjoy greater social and legal equality.<A HREF="#8">(8)</A> Though he knew of
		the 1830 law that prohibited further U.S. settlements in Texas, Lundy hoped
		that Mexican officials would make an exception for him. They did not. Two years
		later, Colonel Juan Almonte suggested to Lundy that he again petition for land
		but in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which was not included in the 1830
		law.<A HREF="#9">(9)</A> Tamaulipas was located just south of Texas and
		straddled the Rio Grande. Although Lundy did not indicate in his recollections
		what motivated Almonte to make this offer, another Mexican official, Senator
		Francisco de Tagle, had suggested as early as 1831 that fugitive slaves be
		given homes on the frontier as a barrier against possible invasion.<A
		HREF="#10">(10)</A> In March of 1835, the Mexican government granted Lundy
		138,000 acres of land in Tamaulipas.<A HREF="#11">(11)</A> Lundy wanted to
		establish at least 250 families within two years.<A HREF="#12">(12)</A>
		Unfortunately, war interceded. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December of 1835, Americans in Texas
		began a fight for independence from Mexico. According to Lundy, they rebelled
		when they "ascertained that slavery could not be perpetuated... under the
		government of the Mexican Republic."<A HREF="#13">(13)</A> In the midst of the
		fighting, many slaves escaped into Mexico but those that moved to Tamaulipas
		found themselves entrapped once more. The Texan nation's new boundaries
		expanded southward to the Rio Grande River. Consequently, Lundy's land grant
		was no longer in Tamaulipas but in Texas; the planned colony never came to
		fruition.<A HREF="#14">(14)</A> Lundy never attempted to establish another
		colony in Mexico and he died in 1839.<A HREF="#15">(15)</A> The Republic of
		Texas declared slavery to be legal and in its ten-year existence, the slave
		population grew 450% from 5,000 to nearly 27,500.<A HREF="#16">(16)</A></P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of mounting tensions between
		Mexico, Texas, and the United States during the 1840s, slavery became an issue
		over which Mexico could assert its sovereignty. Mexican authorities always
		rejected Texans' demands to reclaim their runaways. Texas President Sam Houston
		lamented to U.S. General William Harding in July, 1841, that ". . . two
		valuable negro boys for which I had paid in cash $2100 previous to my visit to
		Nashville, ran away last spring to Mexico. Thus you can see I am in bad
		luck."<A HREF="#17">(17)</A> After the U.S.-Mexican War (1846-1848) Mexico
		continued to assert itself by refusing to enter into any extradition treaties
		with the United States and, although it finally ratified an agreement in 1862,
		it specifically excluded runaway slaves.<A HREF="#18">(18)</A></P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, Mexico remained a place of
		amnesty. However, the absence of an organized network for escapes meant that
		most slaves made their way into Mexico either individually or in small groups.
		Despite this impediment, thousands of fugitive slaves lived in Mexico by 1850.
		But the flow of runaways into Mexico did not compare with the numbers still
		enslaved in Texas. According to the 1850 U.S. census, 58,161 slaves lived in
		Texas, whose entire population was 212,592. Thus, slaves comprised over 28% of
		the population.<A HREF="#19">(19)</A> On the eve of the Civil War, this
		percentage had increased to the point where nearly 1/3 of the total population
		of Texas were slaves.<A HREF="#20">(20)</A></P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the Mexican government
		uncooperative, Texas slaveowners took measures to stop escapes as well as to
		reclaim runaways. In 1850, they pressured the federal government to set up
		border patrols but with few troops assigned to patrol this vast frontier, this
		was not very successful.<A HREF="#21">(21)</A> Slaveowners also offered rewards
		of $200-$600 for the recapturing of fugitives. Noah Smithwick recalled being
		part of a group of men in pursuit of runaway slaves in Texas in 1855.
		Unprepared for the resistance they received, Smithwick's group retreated home.
		Much to his own surprise, Smithwick hoped that the fugitives had made it to
		Mexico.<A HREF="#22">(22)</A> <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("smithwick.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		(See Document One)</A></B> Sometimes, however, Texans did not respect the
		border in their pursuits of runaway slaves. In 1855, Captain James Callahan of
		the Texas Rangers under the orders of Texan Governor Elisha Pease entered
		Mexico in an attempt to recapture slaves. Callahan insisted that the purpose of
		his excursion was to pursue Indians rather than recapture fugitive slaves. The
		Mexican government with the help of Native Americans, however, forced him to
		retreat and withdraw without the slaves; although not without leaving a small
		village in ruins.<A HREF="#23">(23)</A> </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam Houston offered yet another solution
		to the problem of fugitive slaves in Mexico. In 1858, he proposed making Mexico
		a protectorate of the United States because he believed that Mexicans were
		incapable of maintaining a democracy and thus creating a "good neighborhood."<A
		HREF="#24">(24)</A> Although Houston did not originally mention slavery as a
		rationale, in promoting his plan a year later he suggested that slavery would
		aid Mexico's agricultural development. He also said that it would "provide for
		the reclamation of our slaves who escape into her territory."<A
		HREF="#25">(25)</A> </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemingly unaffected by these debates,
		many runaway slaves assimilated into Mexican culture - learning the language
		and the customs. A number of persons left recollections of their encounters. As
		early as 1833, Lundy wrote about a man he met while in San Antonio de Bexar,
		Mexico. <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("lundy.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		(See Document Two)</A></B> Frederick Law Olmsted wrote of meeting an ex-slave
		during his travels through Mexico in 1854. <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("olmsted.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		(See Document Three)</A></B> Mrs. William Cazneau, who lived in the border town
		of Eagle Pass from 1850-1852, documented the experience of an acquaintance of
		hers who encountered an ex-slave in Monterey. <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("cazneau.html", 640, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>
		(See Document Four)</A></B> Much to the surprise of these Americans, these
		former slaves had obtained wealth and status in their new communities. </P>
	 <P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Textbooks and survey courses do not focus
		on the topic of runaway slaves into Mexico probably due to the small known
		numbers. Estimates generally range between 3,000 to 5,000. Yet to focus in on
		just the relatively small numbers of fugitive slaves in Mexico is to miss the
		larger picture. By teaching this topic within the larger context of other
		events in the 19th Century, such as Manifest Destiny, expansion of slavery and
		Mexican independence, it serves to add another integral detail and greater
		understanding to this period in history. </P>
