	 <P><FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT COLOR="#990000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#000000">When I received the letter indicating
		that I had been accepted to attend the Newberry&#146;s National History
		Project, I was excited about the opportunity to do primary source research as
		well as discuss historical topics with other teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The NHP
		allowed me the freedom to pick any America history topic and I initially wanted
		to gain some insight into the Red Scare that took place during and after the
		first World War.&nbsp; I had always questioned the sincerity of the Red Scare
		during the early 1920s.&nbsp; The 1950s Scare seemed reasonable given the very
		real new threat of atomic warfare; but not the World War I Scare.&nbsp;
		Therefore, I wanted to research the role of management in exploiting the Red
		Scare to attack organized labor.<BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My research took
		me in several directions. I examined at some length newspaper articles and
		magazines from the 1910s and 1920s.&nbsp; After spending two straight days,
		eight hours each day, scanning microfilm at Harold Washington Library, I came
		to the conclusion that the job of a historian is tedious.&nbsp; What I
		discovered was that every time there was a strike, editorials blasted the labor
		movement for being connected with communism/bolshevism.&nbsp; I got
		frustrated.&nbsp; Everywhere I looked, I failed to find any interesting
		information.&nbsp; I realized that the answer to my question was
		&#147;yes,&#148; management did use the Red Scare to attack all unions whether
		or not they were radical. There was no subtlety; I could offer no real insight
		into the topic.&nbsp; <BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just about to give up
		when I came across a reference in the Pullman collection to employee
		representation plans. At first I was a bit confused.&nbsp; Why was Pullman, a
		company that was notoriously anti-union, allowing employee representation
		plans?&nbsp; After reading several secondary sources, I discovered that during
		the 1920s, management sought to control unionism by offering workers an
		alternative to collective bargaining.&nbsp; With this new idea in hand, I set
		out to see to what extent this was true in the Pullman Company.&nbsp; The
		evidence I found was overwhelming.&nbsp; Pullman implemented a wide range of
		programs for the purpose of developing employee loyalty to the
		company.&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered that the topic was not without
		subtlety.&nbsp; Even though management sought to attack labor, workers did
		benefit under the new approach.&nbsp; I came to the conclusion that during and
		immediately after World War I, labor and management took the theme of democracy
		and applied it to the workplace.&nbsp; The war had transformed the worker and
		society, making the traditional anti-labor approach ineffective.&nbsp; <BR>
		<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the Pullman Company established a company
		newsletter in May of 1922 entitled Pullman News.&nbsp; Articles included birth
		and death announcements, baseball, basketball and bowling scores, recipes, and
		entertainment pieces.&nbsp; The newsletter also included information of
		employee benefits, election results and worker commendations as well as
		personal ads from the various precincts.&nbsp; <BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		However, the paper also served management&#146;s interests. After examining
		many issues, it became clear that the Pullman News was a management propaganda
		tool that advocated the themes of cooperation and loyalty.&nbsp; For example,
		an article entitled &#147;Ex-office boy Now Assistant General Manager,&#148;
		told the classic Horatio Alger story of how hard work and cooperation will lead
		to success.(1) <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("walden_pullmannews.html", 500, 450,
 "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'> (See Document One)</A></B>
		Similarly, an address from President Carry, not only expressed his own rags to
		riches story but emphasized cooperation and loyalty.(2) <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("carry_pullmannews.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>(See
		Document Two)</A></B><BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost as interesting as what
		was printed, is what was absent from the Pullman News &#150; the topic of
		organized labor. In the midst of the 1922 Shopman&#146;s strike, the Pullman
		press made no reference to it.&nbsp; In fact, in the eight years of newsletters
		I examined, there were no articles on the evil of unionism even though the
		subtext of cooperation and loyalty to the company was anti-union.&nbsp; <BR>
		<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Pullman News, the Company offered a
		wide range of social activities to foster a community spirit, including
		baseball, basketball and bowling leagues as well as a choral group.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		It also sponsored contests and company picnics.<BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Pullman also offered a range of economic reforms.&nbsp; In 1920, Pullman
		instituted a Savings Plan for all of its workers.&nbsp; The goal was to offer a
		better return for the worker since their collective savings would bring a
		higher return than an individual savings plan would.&nbsp; The plan had the
		additional goal of creating loyal, stable workers.&nbsp; In a letter dated
		October 25, 1922, President Cary stated &#147;I have always felt that a workman
		with a bank balance is more conservative in his view and inclined to work more
		steadily &#133; than the man with nothing at stake.&#148; (3) <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("carry_letter.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>(See
		Document Three)</A></B> Pullman also instituted a stock ownership
		plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably the greatest tool
		at controlling the labor question was the adoption of the Employee
		Representation Plan.&nbsp; The plan structure gave employees a voice in the
		management of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; These plans created a three-tier system
		of representation (the Local Committee, the General Committee and the Bureau of
		Industrial Relations) with equal representation of employees and
		management.&nbsp; The local committees heard employee grievances, and if the
		employee was not satisfied with the decision, she or he could appeal it to the
		next level. The stated purpose of this plan was &#147;to promote co-operation
		between the management and the employees and to provide for handling
		expeditiously and settling promptly and fairly all questions which arise as to
		current wages and working conditions and other matters of importance to the
		welfare of the employees.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the stated purpose seems
		benevolent, Frank Simmons, the director of labor relations, gives an
		alternative purpose for a strong Employee Representations Plan:<BR> <BR> &#133;
		My own individual belief is that during this period of labor unrest and of
		extreme activity on the part of various socialistic and communistic
		organizations, it behooves the Company to strengthen and popularize its own
		Plan of Employee Representation as the channel through which employees will
		have representation and a voice in matters affecting their welfare, and if we
		do not do this there is great danger, proved by our own experience, that our
		employees will drift into other and antagonistic organizations which are
		constantly soliciting their membership. (4) <B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("crawford_memorandum.html", 500, 450, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>(See
		Document Four)</A></B> By 1922, Pullman had instituted an Employee
		Representation Plan for all of its workers with the hope of dissuading them
		from joining organized labor.<BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did ERP's grievance
		procedures offer workers a place to settle their complaints? In examining the
		data for the years 1926 to 1934, I discovered some interesting trends. (5)<B><A
		HREF='JavaScript:openPopWin("recapitulation.html", 640, 500, "toolbar,scrollbars,resizable", 20, 20)'>(See
		Document Five)</A></B>&nbsp; Complaints that reached the local committee level
		were more likely to be decided in favor of the employee (43% to 36.9%).&nbsp;
		However, at higher levels management was more often successful (43% to
		39%).&nbsp; More importantly, management received favorable decisions more
		often than did employees in discharge complaints. In discharge cases, the
		numbers are 463 to 249 in favor of management.&nbsp; Thus, the Employee
		Representative Plan allowed workers a marginal level of control and input.<BR>
		&nbsp;<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the guise of industrial democracy, Pullman
		instituted the above reforms aimed at marginally increasing the role of the
		worker without losing control of the workplace to organized labor&#146;s view
		of industrial democracy.<BR> <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final note about the
		experience. The summer institute helped me gain insights into the study of
		history and provided me with the opportunity to explore the nuances of labor
		history. I also appreciated the intellectual camaraderie of the other
		participants, reminding me of my days in college. As a teacher, I wanted to
		stretch my intellectual curiosity and reconnect to academics and I did.<BR>
